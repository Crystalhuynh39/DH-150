A NARRATIVE
OF THE
Captivity and Suffering's
OF
MARIA MARTIN,
WHO WAS SIX YEARS A SLAVE IN.
ALGIERS.
I AM a native of England, and was
born in the year 1779, of respectable and
wealthy parents. In the year 1797, I was
married to captain Henry Martin, who
was commander of one of the East India
Company's ships. Being ever desirous
of visiting some distant part of the world,
I solicited and obtained the consent of
my husband to accompany him a voyage
to Minorca. Accordingly, on the twen.
tieth of June 1800, we set sail in the ship
Unicorn, on board of which there were
one hundred souls, twelve of whom were
passengers. We enjoyed for several
weeks a pleasant wind, and nothing oc-
curred to obstruct our passage until the

27th July, when at the very moment that
the soft breeze fanned every soul to sleep,
when every fear of danger was banished,
all care forgotten, and the wearied lulled
in the arms of Morpheus to sweet repose,
then, in an instant, we were all roused,
by the striking of the ship upon a rock.!
Our amazement and horror cannot be dea
scribed in order to do it, the reader must
realize my feelings at that moment. We
were soon overwhelmed by the tempest
of the sea.
The crew were in the ut.
most confusion-some swearing, and
others praying.
At day light next morning, we found
ourselves in a deplorable situation, the
ship on her beam ends, with four feet of
water in her hold, and a heavy sea conți-
nually breaking over uş. In order to
lighten the vessel, the foremast was cut
away, and the guns thrown overboard,
this plan had its desired effect, for in a
few minutes we found ourselves afloat in
deep water, and saw astern of us, the rock
that had caused us so much trouble and
anxiety of mind. All hands being im-
mediately, set to work in repairing and

clearing the ship of water, we had the
pleasure of seeing ourselves the follow-
ing day in a situation to proceed on our
voyage.
Nothing from this moment transpired,
worthy of record, until the 14th of Au.
gust, when we met with a far more fatal
disaster ; about sun-set, we were alarm-
ed at the sight of a vessel we discovered,
which Capt. Martin imagined to be a
French frigate, and to avoid her, he al-
tered the ship's course ; the wind at this
moment began to blow unusually strong,
and with the night increased to a hurri.
cane. The night was extremely dark,
and the sea running high and breaking
over us, rendered it impossible to keep a
light in the binnaclewe were therefore
obliged to lash the helm and trust to the
mercy of the waves. At day light the
storm began in some measure to abate-
at 9 A. M. it entirely subsided. :::
At 2 P. M. as we were taking some re-
freshment in the cabin, the boatswain
came and told my busband that the co-
lour of the water had changed; upon
which he reprinianded him, and told him

tinued our course under a foresail; but
our terror and surprise was not to be
expressed, when in the morning watch,
my husband being upon deck, discovered
land right a-head, he came down imme-
diately into the cabin, and with tears in
his eyes, desired I would arise. By his
countenance I judged that something ex.
traordinary was the matter ; I instanily
arose and went upon deck, and plainly
saw the land but a short distance a-head !
The land had the appearance of sand-
hanks, and the ship's crew did all they
could to weather them, but the ship
having a round head, she would not obey
the helm, therefore it was agreed to make
in for the land, hoping, as it had the ap-
pearance of a bold shore, that we might,
through Providence, land safe. It how-
ever proving ebb: tide, the ship struck
upon one of the banks, but by lightening
the ship, and cutting away her masts by
the board, got clear of that; but keeping

still in for the shore, we soon after struck
upon another sand bank, but not very
violently, so we threw out our ship's an-
chors in hopes we might ride out the
tide ; but the wind increasing, we dragged
them, and were violently thrown upon
another sand bank, where the ship stuck,
and the waves dashed over us, There
were several children on board, the dis-
mal cries of whom at this awful moment,
could not fail to pierce the hardest heart.
Capt. Martin ordered the boat out, to
see if we could gain the shore that way,
a number jumped into her, but ere they
could leave the ship, she was stayed to
pieces.
There were on board two blacks, that
were excellent divers, (for the surge was
so violent no one could stem the billows
but by diving) who offered to get with a
rope on shore, and fasten it from the ship
to the rocks. The negroes accordingly
plunged into the sea, and in a few mo.
ments we had the satisfaction to see them
land and make fast the rope, by the as-
sistance of which they again returned to
the ship. My husband, the mate and

myself ventured into the water first, upan
the awning of the ship, and got safe on
shore. The captain's clerk, the boat-
swain, and two sailors next came on
shore, but no sooner were they landed,
than the rope broke, and as the two ne,
groes had left us, all hopes of saving any
more from the ship was at an end ; alas!
my ears are even pierced at this moment
with their cries, which was more terrible
to me than the storm.
Soon after our arrival on shore, my hus.
band, the mate and boatswain, went in
search of inhabitants, but in a few hours
returned, and informed me that they
could not discover any ; our grief was
now renewed, for we were apparently in
as much danger of starving now, as we
had been of drowning a few hours be-
fore.
While we were lamenting our condi-
tion, we heard somebody hollow, up in
the woods, which revived our drooping
senses ; but running to see who it was,
we, much to our grief, found it to be one
of ihe sailors that escaped, who was hol-
lowing to his companion.

When we were together, my husband
proposed that we should walk to the
southward, to see if it were possible to
find any inhabitants ; but in less than an
hour, our journey was obstructed by an
impenetrable wood, and we were com-
pelled to return. We then steered our
course northward, but were interrupted
by large swamps. Thus marooned as we
were, we went back again, and could per-
ceive the poor wretches in the vessel
liſting up their hands to us for succour.
Capt. Martin made signs to them to let
them know that our condition was as bad
as theirs. I growing near night, some
of the poor creatures ventured into the
water, but were soon drowned. In short,
every object we beheld increased our hors
None of us had eat or drank for
two days. My poor husband though
quite cast down himself, endeavoured to
cheer his fellow-sufferers; and that we
might be sheltered from the inclemency
of the night (which to add to our wretch-
ed condition, proved a rainy one) the
men by joint consent and labour while
the day lasted, collected a great number

in the morning, by my request, we ad-
dressed ourselves to the all-seeing Power
for succour. After our extempore ori.
sons were over, we rose up and resolved
to go into the woods, to gather if possible,
something to kill our hunger. We did
not travel far before the mate, who was a
little way a-head, came running toward
us, and told us that he had discovered a
few rods distant, a number of men of a
very tawny complexion, armed with long
spears; we did not hesitate a moment to
meet then, whether friends or foes, for
we felt ourselves unable any longer to
live without focd. As soon as they dis-
covered us, they advanced towards us in

füll speed; when within hail, they ac-
costed us in a language which we did not
understand ; ny husband addressed them
in English and then in French, but they
did not appear to understand what he
said, the mate then addressed them in
Spanish, but with no better success--one
of the sailors who had been a prisoner
among the Moors, next addressed them
in the Moresco language, and by one or
two of them appeared to be understood,
who, in reply, declared us " their pri.
soners.' By the request of my husband,
the sailor, who had now become our in-
terpreter, enquired the name of the coun.
try in which we were the reply was,
“you are in Barbary, 30 miles from Te.
nis, and 90 from the city of Algiers.
We were at this instant surrounded
by the barbarians, who brandishing their
spears, commanded us to follow them.
The sailor told them that we were British
subjects, with whom the Bey of Algiers
was at peace ; to this, however, they paid
little or no attention, but compelled us to
accompany them. About sun-set, we
arrived at Mostago, a village 27 miles

from Tenis, where we tarried that night,
and the next morning proceeded for Oran,
The news of our arrival was soon made
known, and the inhabitants collected in
great numbers to view us.-By our inter-
preter we discovered that those by whom
we were captured, were representing us
as natives of Portugal, that we were part
of the crew of a privateer of that na-
tion, which had been shipwrecked on
their coast. As the Portuguese were then
at war with no nation but the Algerines;
the wicked lie of these unprincipled bar-
barians had its desired effect, and so en-
raged the multitude, that they could hard-
ly be restrained from laying violent hands
on us.
It appeared to be the policy of our cap.
tors to represent us as an enemy, as they
well knew that we should be disposed of
ås such, and that they, agreeable to a law
of their country, would be entitled to one
half of the purchase money—but, to the
contrary, had it been known that we were
British subjects, the English consul at
Algiers would have demanded us as such.


## p. 69 (#75) ##############################################

69
My husband's greatest concern was,
that we should be disposed of to different
persons, and separated, never perhaps to
see each other again, and too soon were
his expectations verified, for the day after
our arrival, we were drove up like so many
cattle which are to be exposed for sale, to
the public market, where were gathered
a great number of bidders ; among them
I recognized many of my own sex, which
gave me fresh hopes of protection, but,
alas ! this fond hope was of but short du.
ration, for so far from exhibiting any pity
for me, they seemed rather to exult in
my miseries! One of the ruffians who
claimed me as their property, conducted
me to the Cadi, or principal governor of
the place, who was a little, ugly, old look-
ing man, besmeared with dirt, barefoot
and bare legged, to him I was recom-
mended as a valuable in-door slave ; he
was very critical in the examination of
my person ; my limbs, teeth, eyes, &c.
were very closely inspected. Afier un-
dergoing a thorough examination by more
than one hundred different persons, I was
struck off to a Turk; I was then led out

the care of his son, who was seated on a
log a few yards therefrom, awaiting the
departure of his father.

choly view of my unhappy fellow slaves,
whose countenances, as they stole a pity-
ing glance toward me, bespoke more
than the tongue can express! they were
employed in their daily occupation, which
was to load large carts with rocks and
huge stones blown from the ledges near
the shore, and to convey them to a valley
about one mile distant; those employed
to load the carts, had large collars about
their necks, made much after the form
of those worn by the West-India slaves;
those allotted to draw the carts, were
chained thereto. To witness the dis-
tress, and to hear the despairing groans
of those poor creatures, could not fail to
draw a tear from the eye of any one but
a merciless barbarian ! Under the heavy
weight of the lash, they were compelled
to perform the severest tasks; half naked,
their scorched and lacerated bodies exhi.
bited a frightful proof of the brutality

exercised toward them by those merciless
barbarians.
A very great portion of the inhabitants
of Tenis are Moors, a description of the
manners and customs of which
may
be
entertaining to my readers. They are
of a tawny complexion, of a lazy, idle
disposition, and addicted to all the vices
of mankind ; mistrustful to the last de
gree, false, jealous, and the very picture
of ignorance. They stile themselves
musselmen, or true believers ; yet their
word is not to be relied on. They
abominate the christians, for the very
word in their language signifies dog; and
are continually seeking means to destroy
them." Mahomet has taught them in
his Alcoran, that all who die fighting
agai. st christiants, immediately enter in
to paradise, in triumph"; nay, even their
houses, if they die in battle, are immedi-
ately translated into heaven.
Though poligamy is allowed, yet they
must marry but four wives, and must
settle a dowry upon them; they are
strictly forbidden marrying or having ans
intercourse with a christian woman ; those

their fingers. The prayer consists only
in the different attributes of God, as
God is great, God is good, God is infi-
nite, God is merciful.
The Cadi (or Governor) of Tenis, only
differs from his subjects in a larger pro-
pensity to their ill qualities, with the ad-
dition of a degree of cruelty and avarice.
I was one day a spectator to his wanton
cruelty ; having been sent on some errand
by my Turkish master, I perceived him
giving directions to some of his workmen;
there were scveral carts drove by his

slaves, with materials for his house, and
as they passed him he bastinadoed some
for going too fast, while others, thinking
to mend that fault, were drubbed by him
for going too slow ; one poor creature,
trembling for fear what would follow,
went bowing before his cart, but the
Cadi, wounding his horse in the flank, he
gave a spring, tumbled the poor wretch
down and drove over him. Another
following him, ran to assist his fellow
creature, but the Cadi threw his dart and
struck him in the shoulder; the slave
drew it out, and upon his knees present-
ed it to him again, which the Cadi (when
the man had got a little distance from.
him) darted the second time into his
body! The poor creature drew it out
once more, and, covered with blood,
gave it to him back again, but as he was
stooping, he fell down with loss of blood
at the barbarian's feet, who did him the
favour to pin him to the earth through his
back.
The Cadi is said to possess a great
deal of wit and courage, is very active
and expert in riding and hurling the dart.

The Moors shave their heads close, ex-
cept one lock upon the crown of their
heads, which they never cut off, they
being taught that by that lock Mahomet
is to draw them up to their imaginary
paradise.
I could not forbear smiling to see the
policy practised by the Moors in one in-
stance ; walking one day about a mile
from Tenis, after my release from capti-
vity, it began to rain violently, I got un-
der a tree to shelter myself from the tem-
pest, but I observed several of the Moors
undress themselves with a great deal of
precipitancy, make up their clothes in a
bundle, and sit on them stark naked ;
this was to prevent their being wet, while
their naked bodies were exposed to the
fury of the storm. When it ceased to

bodies were dry, and then dressed them.
selves,
The dress of the Moors chiefly consists
of a robe or caften of serge, woolen stuff,
or blue and white cotton, and sometimes,
but very seldom, of silk. They are
also clothed in a shirt, which is tied round
the neck, and is so wide as to fold two
or three times about the body ; this is
bound round the waist by a sash, in which
is stuck a long knife like a bayonet, and
sometimes two. The dress of both the
men and women consists of such a large
shirt, generally of black linen, and a cloth
with which the women cover their head
and shoulders; the men sometimes roll-
ing it about their heads, in imitation of
a turban, and sometimes round the mid.
dle. Some of the women wear their hair
tied up in a knot, and others let it hang
down ; but the men are in general very
negligent about it. They wear sandals,
or rather socks, of Morocco leather,
which raise to the small of the leg; and
their heads are covered with a red bon.

long lo se robe of white or striped cotton,
or woolen stuff, above described, which
they frequently wear over their capacious
shirt, they call halk, and is extremely be-
coming. This robe has a long pointed
hood that falls down behind, to the ex-
tremity of which hangs a tassel by a long
string. However, the pour are clothed
after the manner of the negroes.
The women, as I before mentioned,
wear a long cotton shift ; this has long
and wide sleeves; they have likewise
large drawers, and a piece of calico, or
linen, that covers them from head to foot,
and flows in an easy manner behind.
They are all adorned with ear-rings and
pendants, which are valuable in propor-
tion to the wearer's station and quality.
When a considerable number of tents
or cabins are placed together, and form a
kind of town or village, they call it
Adouar. These villages are usually of
a circular form, the tents standing very
thick, and in the centre is an empty
space in which they keep their cattle.

inactivity as highly culpable.

larges itself in proportion to its length,
which is sometimes above thirty feet.
In some parts of the country the peo.
ple it is said have portable mills, with
which they grind their corn as they want
it. Their manner of eating resembles
that of the Asiatics. At their meals they
sit cross-legged round a covering of lea-
ther, or a mat of palm leaves, spread upon
the ground, upon which their dishes or
plates of copper or ivory are laid ; and
they never drink till they rise in order to
wash, a ceremony that cannot be omitted
without the greatest indecency. They
never allow themselves more than two
meals a day, one in the morning and the
other at night, and the women are never
allowed to eat with the men. Their re-
past is short and silent, not a syllable
being uttered till they have washed and
returned to their pipe and coffee, and then
conversation begins.
From this temperance in their meals,
arises that strong health which renders
them strangers to medicine, the study of
which was so much cultivated by their
predecessors.

and pleurisies, both which they are said
to cure by the internal and external ap-
plication of simples. The inhabitants
are said to live to a great age, without
experiencing what sickness is, seldom
dying before the animal powers are wasted
by years.
With them a man at sixty is

The mothers have a passionate fond-
ness for their children, and take the ut.
most care to prevent their being injured
by any accident. The boys are permit-
ted to marry as soon as they can purchase
a wife, which is done by presents to the
parents, of camels, horses, and horned
cattle. They estimate the affection of
the husband from his liberality, and the
young lady is never delivered to him till
by his presents he has made her parents
sensible of his merits. If upon her be-

his expectations of her beauty or chas-
tity, he may send her back ; but in this
case he forfeits the presents he has
made.
A man las no sooner breathed his last,
than one of his women, or some relation,
puts her head in at the door of the tent,
and bursts into a terrible cry ; upon which
all the women within the village set up
a lamentable shriek and dismal screams,
which alarm the whole camp or village.
With respect to the learning of the
Moors, it is so extremely limited, that
few of them are able to read or write ;
yet some of them have a tolerable notion
of astronomy, and talk with precision
upon the stars, their number, situation,
and division into constellations. The
clear and serene sky in which they live,
has greatly assisted their observations,
which advantage they have improved by
arwarm imagination and a happy memo-
ry: their system of astronomy is, how-
ever, so replete with fable and absurdity,
that it is in general difficult to compre-
hend their meaning ; yet with all their

their music, it might be inferred, that

mous. “Can any thing,” they say, "be
more dastardly, than to kill a man before
you approach him near enough to be dis-
tinquished ?” Hence they never attack
an enemy till they come within the length
of their ances, and then retiring to a pro-
per distance, throw them or shoot their
arrows with surprising dexterity. They
fight chiefly on horseback with short
stirrups, and by raising themselves high
in the saddle, strike with great force.
They never draw up their cavalry in long
lives and extended wings, but in small
detatched squadrons, by which means,
they are less liable to be broke or thrown
into confusion; and when such an acci-
dent happens, are more easily formed.

The cruel oppressions which the Moors
of Tenis suffer wider the tyrannical gov.
ernment of Algiers, have greatly contri.
buted to their degeneracy ; and a more
abject condition than theirs can scarcely
be conceived.
Can we imagine a situation more
adapted to depress the human mind, or
render man completely miserable ? But
it is far from producing these effects :
froni their unparalelled patience, under
these various kinds of what others would
esteem the greatest wretchedness, they
enjoy a tolerable share of happiness.
On seeing a number of these Moors
sitting at the doors of their wretched cots,
half naked, some smoking, and telling
merry tales, others singing or dancing,
one would conclude them to be a happy,
though a lazy people.
There are but few Turks in Tenis,
they are a wretched crew of indigent,
ragged, thievish fellows. These wretches
being furnished with a gun, a sword,
and other arms, are incorporated into
some regiment, and soon obtain a vote
and share in the government ; and from

that situation are raised from one post to
another, till they obtain those of admiral,
vizier, and even bey. The Turks treat
their slaves very barbarously ; at night
they confine them in dungeons, and in
the day time compel them to toil in

a little bread and water.
Having in the preceding pages mi-
nutely described the manners and cus-
toms of the Moors, who are the principal
inhabitants of Tenis, I shall now proceed
to give a more particular account of my
own sufferings while
among
them.
My Turkish master having completed
his business, after a few moments con-
versation with his son, by whom I had
been guarded, commanded me to arise
and follow him. I was conducted through
several filthy lanes and alleys, which led
to the habitation of my new master---the
house was large and commodious, but
not elegant--he was the possessor of
between forty and fifty christian slaves,
all of whom, except ten, were Portuguese,
nine of the latter were Napoleans, and
one a native of England. I was indeed

extremely sorry to find one of my own
countrymen in as deplorable a condition
as myself, yet in him I found a real and
valuable friend, and without the aid and
assistance of whom, I should in all
pro-
bability at this moment have been still
held in bitter captivity.
My unfortunate friend (whose name
was Malcome, and who had been five
years in captivity) informed me that our
master was grand Vizier of the city, and
a great favourite of the then reigning Bey
of Algiers--that he was a blood-thirsty,
cruel and inhuman monster, who, to his
knowledge, had put several of his slaves
to death for no greater fault than that of
complaining of indisposition, and an ina-
bility to perform their daily tasks.
He mentioned several instances where-
in he had been most unmercifully tortur.
ed for attempting to communicate infor-
mation of his captivity, to the English
Consul, at Algiers—his nails had been
torn from his fingers and toes, and his
whole body lacerated in a manner not to
be described. I could not discover one
among the whole number of slaves claim .

nails of their fingers and toes !--To me,
this was indeed a shocking spectacle !
it gave me to understand what kind of
treatment I should myself receive, if so
unfortunate as to incur the displeasure of
the wretch.
Soon after my arrival I was divested
of my cloathing, and presented with a suit
like those worn by the other captives; I
was then conducted into an adjoining
out-house, which proved to be the cook

As soon as I entered, I was ordered to
proceed immediately to business ;
had placed over us as overseer, a woman
who if possible, surpassed her employer
in acts of barbarity; she was a native of
Morocco, and seemed to glory in having
it in her power to torture and torment us,
by every means and in every way that her
inventive faculties could give birth to.
The wretch would not unfrequently com-
pel us, for the least offence, io strip our-
selves naked, and then stand for a given
number of minutes within a few feet of a
blazing fire ! --at other times she would
throw hot embers and coals of fire into
our bosoms; and shocking as it may ap-
pear, she in my presence deprived of life
a poor unfortunate girl, by strewing her
naked body with hot rice ! Under the
controul of such a governess, my readers
will acknowledge that my situation must
have been truly wretched ; but, alas !

sighs and tears availed nothing, they were
only productive of stripes ! there were
but few among our number but would
have chosen death rather than life.
Confined and employed with the other
slaves, in cooking, &c. as before men-
tioned, nothing worthy of record took
place until about 13 months from the
time of my capture, when the thunder.
ing of cannon announced the approach
of an event of no little magnitude. About
3 o'clock, P. M. orders were received
from the grand Vizier (our master) for us
to repair as soon as possible to a fortifi-
cation at the harbour's mouth; on arriv.
ing at which, we discovered the cause of
the alarm. The Napoleans with a well-
manned fleet of gun-boats, &c. had com.
menced a tremendous cannonade on the
city, and we were ordered here for the
purpose of conveying ammunition to the
besieged, from the magazine, a business
always allotted female captives in time of
action. At half past 7 A.-M. the cannon-
ade became terrible, while all was bustle
and confusion among the besieged ; they

discharged some few cannon against
their assailants, but without doing appa.
rent injury. At 2 P. M. the firing ceased,
but at 4 it again commenced, when red
hot balls were thrown into the city, and
with so good effect, that in a few mo-
ments the castle, together with most of
the public buildings were set on fire,
and the greatest part of the city reduced
to ashes; the slain and wounded were
immense. I was at this moment employ.
ed as I had been during the whole siege,
in furnishing the Algerines with powder,
yet I could have a fair view of what was
going on, and was not a little pleased to
see many of that barbarous nation made
to bite the dust!
The Napoleans having expended all
their powder, and probably feeling satis-
fied with the injuries they had done their
enemies, sailed out of the harbour in tri.
umph at sun-rise, the succeeding morn-
ing; orders were immediately thereupon
issued for the prisoners (who had been
employed in defence of the city) to as-
semble and assist in removing the rub.

scene presented to view ! the streets
strewed with the dead and dying ! On
whatever side I turned my eyes, my atten.
tion was attracted by mangled bodies and
detached limbs, bleeding afresh. Among
a number of captives employed in bury-
ing the dead, I thought I recognized my
unfortunate husband, but dare not ap-
proach him, as my master kept a watchful
eye on me.
The business allotted the female cap-
tives, was to strip the dead, after which
they were thrown into waggons and drawn
off by the male captives, to what place I
could never learn. The wounded were
carried on the shoulders of captives to the
hospitals, where they were visited by the
Cadi, and presented with, six dollars
each.
After the bustle and confusion had a
little subsided, we were again ordered to
our place of confinement and labour,
from whence we had been taken, we had
not, however, been long here before we
were again aroused by the discharge of
cannon, and beating of the raritoo, a cus-
tomary signal for the slaves to assemble.

It was at this moment that I could plainly
perceive a sudden change of countenance
in
my fellow captives, those in an especial
manner who had been long in captivity.
Our governess hurried us off as quick as
possible to the castle, at the door of which
were assembled (as I judged) nearly 1000
people, and the captives were then con-
tinually flocking in. About 3 P. M. or.
ders were given by the grand Vizier (my
master) for the forming a procession, and
it was at this moment that I learned the
cause of our assembling : it appeared that
during the late action, a captive belonging
to the Cadi had made an attempt to
escape, by swimming to one of the ene.
my's boats, but was observed, pursued
and retaken. The affair so exasperated
the Cadi, that he gave orders for his im.
mediate execution. For the information
of the reader, it may be well to mention,
that on all such occasions, it is ever cus-
tomary for the captives to attend, gene-
rally, that they may be eye witnesses to
those scenes of savage torture, inflicted
by the barbarians on such as attempt an
escape, in order to deter them from mak-

About 4 P. M. a procession was form-

victim into as small pieces as one's little
finger.
The grand Vizier dismounted and
ascended a lofty stage, a station always
prepared for him on such occasions, and
from which he gave orders for his execu.
tioners (three barbarous looking Turks)
to bring forward the unhappy victim, at
the same time commanding silence. The
poor fellow was instantly dismounted and
led up to the accursed machine ; he was
next stripped and his body washed by

was drawn to the fatal shears, which at

After a close confinement of nearly
three
years, I was one evening visited by
my master, who was accompanied by my
friend Malcome; the latter had been
nearly eight years in captivity, and had
learned to speak the language of the coun:
try extremely well, and many times

my friend, - he could converse with me
in presence of his master upon any sub.

means to gratify a lustful passion, he had

willingly consent to indulge him in what
he should request, he would extend to me
the same liberty which his wives (or con-
cubines) enjoyed :--but, continued my
friend Malcome, fear not, do not be ter-

every thing in his power to compel you
to comply with his request, but should'
he attempt any such thing against your
will, he will lose his head.
versation was held in the presence of my
ruffian master, to whom my friend was
to interpret my answer, which he inform-
ed me he did in the following words-viz.
That I would never consent to gratify him
in his unlawful request, as it would be in
direct violation of the laws of my God
and my country.

this unexpected reply, desired Malcome
to inform me that he would give me a day
to consider on it, but if I should then re-
fuse, he would adopt such a plan as should
soon make me repent of my folly-say,
ing this, he left me ; but my mind was en-
dued with that fortitude, that I resolved
sooner to die, than to submit to his bru.
tal proposals.
Early the succeeding morning I was
again called upon by my master, accom.
panied by my friend Malcome, through
whom inquiry was made whether I had
concluded to comply with his proposal ;
my answer, as interpreted by my friend
was, “No! I will sooner suffer death!”
This was an answer as displeasing as it
was unexpected to the tyrant-he be..
came now like a mad-man, drawing his
dirk he threatened me with instant death,
unless I would immediately comply with
his request ; but finding that I still per:

swearing that my obstinacy should yet
cost me my life! All this was inter-
preted to me by my friend, who, as he

his power to protect me from the vio.

The plan next pursued by my master
to accomplish his wishes, was, to repre.
sent me to his friend, the bey, as a per.
son sent into the country to conspire
against the government! This plan, in
part, had its desired effect, for no sooner
was the bey informed of this, than he or-
dered me to be conveyed immediately to
Sersel (situated within a few miles of the
city of Algiers) there to be confined in
irons, in an apartment of an old castle.
The room in which I was confined was
built of rough stone, and the walls were
about eight feet in depth; it contained but
one small window, with large iron grat-
ings, and which afforded so little light
that I could hardly discern an objcct six
feet from me. My furniture consisted of
a three legged stool, and a gallon stone
jug, which was occasionally filled with
stinking water.
On the second day of my confinement,
a smith entered my apartment with a
hammer and chains in abundance, which,

these afflictions, trusted for her recovery
to the efforts of nature alone !
Sickness itself is sufficient to humble
the mightiest mind ; what then is sickness
with such an addition of torment! The
burning fever, the violent head-achs, my
neck, swelled and inflamed with the irons,
enraged me almost to madness. The
fever and the fetters together, flead my

burning entrails with cold water, the jug
broke! I had four-and-twenty hours to
remain without water.
On my attendants visiting me the next
day, they supposed the dead, as I lay mo.
tionless with my tongue out of my mouth.
They poured water down my throat, and
found life.

Gracious Being ! how pure, how deli.
cious, how exquisite, was this water!
My insatiable thirst soon emptied the jug,
they filled it anew, bade me farewell,
hoped death would soon relieve my mor-
tal sufferings, and departed.
Three days had passed before I could
again eat a morsel of bread. The irons
every where round my body, and their
weight was insupportable ; nor could I
imagine it was possible I should habituate
myself to them, or endure them long
enough to expect deliverance. A thou-
sand reasons convinced me it was neces-
sary to end my sufferings. I shall not
enter into theological disputes : let those
who blame me imagine themselves in my
situation ; or rather first let them actu-
ally endure my miseries, and then let
them reason.
What strange thing is that called hap-
piness ? How shall I express my extreme
joy, when after eleven months intolerable
hunger, I was indulged with a sweet loaf
of bread free from mould? The fond
lover never rushed more eagerly to the
arms of his bride ; the famished tiger

you cannot procure; remember how sim.

should indeed have been driven to des.

relief. When my attendants opened my
dungeon, they found me in a truly pitiful
situation, wondered
at my appetite,
brought me another loaf; I refused to ac.
cept it, believing I should never more
have occasion for bread; they however
left it with me, gave me water, shrugged
up their shoulders, and left me.

Early one morning I heard the door's
of my dungeon unbarring the doors of
my dungeon for the last time resounded !
--a gentleman clad in Christian habit
accompanied by the keeper, entered-joy
beamed upon his countenance-it was
the English Consul.
"I have come,
madam,(said he) to liberate you from un.
just and cruel bondage !" Oh! what
joy did I feel on the occasion ; it was a
long time before I could be convinced of
the truth of what he told me, nor could I
believe it until a smith was sent for to
knock off my irons. .
I was now re-conducted out of the
dark and dismal dungeon, in which I had
been closely confined for three years. It
appeared that my friend Malcome, in the
absence of his master, had been favoured
with an opportunity to escape, which he
improved and arrived in safety at Algiers,
here he found the English consul, and to
him related the particulars of his captivi-
ty, and informed him of my wretched si.
tuation, and the principal cause of my un-
just imprisonment. The consul, accom-
panied by the informant waited upon the

bey, and made a demand of me as one of
his Britannic majesty's subjects, unjust-
ly and unlawfully held in captivity. The
bey at first discredited the story of Mal.
come, and seemed confirmed in the be-
lief that I had been sent into the coun-
try for some treasonable purpose, but on
being assured by the consul that he would
leave the country within twenty-four hours
if I was not immediately released, the bey
consented to deliver me up.
The consul conducted himself with a
great deal of humanity towards me, he
procured for me a suit of clothes of which
I was very much in want, and promised
to procure me a passage to England as
soon as possible. I acquainted him with
the misfortunes of my husband and those
who were saved from the ship, but was
unable to inform him what had become of
them since I parted with them at the mar.
ket house; he informed me that he would
do all in his power to learn their fate, and
if still living, he would procure their re-
lease immediately, but, added he, as it is
not at the present moment convenient for
me to go in search of them, and your

health being much impaired by long con-
finement, you had, I think, better em-
brace the first. opportunity to return to
your friends. I thanked him for his
friendly advice as well as for the many
services he had rendered me, and told
him that I would do whatever he should
think for the best. Accordingly, on the
sixth day after my liberation, I once more
embarked to visit my native country, with
à view of which, after a tedious passage
of 45 days, my eyes were once more re.
galed.
As soon as I landed, a carriage was
procured for me, at the expense of the
captain, to convey me to the dwelling of
iny parents. About sun-set I arrived,
my aged father met me at the door; my
sudden and unexpected arrival was too
much for him, he fainted! Here it may
be necessary to inform the reader, that as
my friends had never received any news
of the vessel or crew, they had concluded
that we had all long since been buried in
the deep.
Although providentially restored to my
friends, misfortune and disappointment

seemed yet to mark me as their own! I
had been flattering myself with the fond
hope that on my arrival, I should be so
fortunate as to meet with my husband,
whom I fattered myself might have pos-
sibly escaped, but no news of him had
been received since his departure. But,
with what pleasure do I close this melan-
choly relation of my sufferings, by adding
that six months after my arrival, my
husband arrived, and apparently in a
good state of health, having obtained his
liberty through the influence of the Bri-
tish consul.

THE END
