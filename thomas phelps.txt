A True Account of my being taken, and
Sufferings during my Captivity.
Pon the 27th day of Auguſt 1684. I Thomas
Phelps ſet ſail from the Downs in a Veſſel called
the Succeſs of London, about fourty Tuns, laden
with Salt, bound for a place in Ireland called
- the Pentrey, where we arrived the 10th, da
of September ; I ſtayed there ſome while, and kill'd Beat,
deſigning for the Madera's and Mount Sarrat; accordingly
on the Zoth of September, I ſet ſail for the Madera's, but
my deſign was croſt, and my Voyage ſtopt as followeth :
Upon the 5th. of Ottober (being then a Hundred Leagues,
Weſt off the Rock of Lisbon) we ſaw a ſail to windward of
us,which immediatly we found to give us chace;we made what
ſail we could from him, and night coming on, we had, for
about Two hours, loſt ſight of him, but at the riſing of the
Moon, he got ſight of us, and quickly came up with us, hail-
ingus whence our Ship, we anſwered from London, deman-
ding the like of him, who made anſwer from Algeir, and
withal commanded us to hdiſt out our Boat, which we re-
fuſed to do, but we brac'd our head-ſailes for him, immº-
diatly ine ſent his Boat towards us, when it was got almoſt
by our ſide, we gave them Three ſhouts, which ſo ſurpriz'd
them, that they thought it convenient to retire aboard their

own Ship; We were not a little chear'd at their departure
and made from them with all the ſail we could make, for we
had not one great Gun, and as for Powder, I believe one ſin-
gle pound was the outmoſt of our ſtore: Pathe mean time he
was hoiſting in of his Boat, I had got above two miles from
him, which made me think I was clear of him, and withal
that the Ship muſt be an Algerine, ſhe appearing ſo great, that,
according to the ſtories in Englund, I thought no ſuch Ship
could belong to Sallé; But i found my ſelf within a little
while, mightily miſlaken, for as ſoon as his Boat was hoi-
ſted in, he preſently fetch'd us up again: We had try’d his
ſailing all ways, but found we could not wrong him any way ;
ſo ſeeing him a ſtern, and a thing impoſſible to loſe ſight of
tis, I put out à light for him, notwithſtanding I was poſſeſt
it that time (God knows) with fear enough, but Ithought,
: Dark, my ſeeming confidence and reſolution might
impºſe upon him, ſo as to fancy I was of ſome force : Ānd
truly afterwards he confeſſed to me, that he thought I had ſix
Gufis aboard and that I did intend to fight him.
He kept a ſtern of me all night, and in the morning he put
out Turkiſh colours, which ſanſwered with our Engliſh ;
then he came up, and ſaw Łhad no boat in fight, for my
boat was ſtow'H'down betwixt decks, he commanded me
therefore to brace to my head-ſailes, and then he ſent his
boat to demand my paſs; Aboard her was an antient Moor,
who formerly had been a ſlave in England and ſpoke good
Engliſh, and who was ſet at liberty by our late Gracious King
£harles the ºd. He ſeeing us in readineſs with what arms.
we had, ask'd me, if I had a mind to break the Peace, he
told me I needed not trouble my ſelf to keep them out of our
Weſſel, for none of them could be perſwaded to come aboard
I brought him my Cuſtom-houſe-Cocketts, for I had no
Paſs : The Moor aforeſaid carried them to the criº.

n after returned, and told me that would not ſatisfit the
Captain, unleſs the Maſter himſelf would come : i made 40-
ſwer that I would not come, that I had done what I was 3-
blig'd to by the Articles 'twixt Bngland and Algiers: The
boat a ſecond time put away for their Ship, and whilſt .
they were hoiſting in their boat, I made what ſail I could,
. was got a mile or more from them again, entertaining
better hopes than 1 was in the night before ; But as ſoon as
the boat was in and ſtow'd, the Moors made ſail and came up
with me again, the Captain ordering to tell me, that if l re-
fus’d to come a board him, he would come aboard me with
his Ship; with that he rang'd up my Weather quarter, I im-
º; put a ſtays, which put him into ſome confuſion,
fothat he was forced to put a ſtays alſo : He had then no Gun,
which I could perceive, I ſaw his Ports, and his Waſt was
Man-high . As I came about I run under his ſtern, then bore
away right before the Wind, he ſoon came up with me, but
not one ſhot pas'd all this while, he demanded of me why I
clapt a ſtays for to run a thwart his halſe; I anſwered that I
doubted he was not of Algier, he ſwore in Engliſh, to me
that he was, elſe before this he would have diſcover'd him-
ſelf, and withal he told me, that if I did not come aboard,
he would ſtraightway ſink me, and ſo he hoiſted out his boat,
in the mean time I boar away, but his boat coming up ma
me bring to again and brace a back; His boat then came a-
board, I ask'd this Moor, who ſpoke Engliſh, what ſhip of
Algiers this was , he very readily without ſtammering
told me, ſhe was call'd the Tagerene young Canary Com-
mander, I immediatly then went into his boat; ſo ſoon as I
came aboard, the Captain ask'd me why I was ſo hard of be-
lief, My diſtruſt was ſuch then that I pray'd the Captain now
that he had me aboard in his power, to reſolve me whether
he were a Sallé-man or not, he ſwore to me again that he
was of Algiers, and that I loº, be wrong'd : He made

attempt to come near, but endeavour as much as they can,
‘me ſit down, and caus’d them to ſet Dates and Figgs before me:
A little after the Captain told me that he was made acquainted
by his men that they ſaw two Portugueſes aboard my Ship,
and that he would have them out, and then I ſhould be gone
about my buſineſs, I told him I had none ſuch aboard, but he
would ſce them two men, ſo two men were ſent for, after
that he told me there were three more and them he muſt
have, well to be ſhort, at laſt he wasſuſpicious that I was a
Portugueſe alſo, and to convince me that I was one,I found my
entertainment preſently withdrawn? Thus did this faithleſs
Barbarian ſerve me, until he had wheadled all my men aboard
him except two, and then the valiant Moors entred my Weſ.
fel with abundance of courage, heaving the two remaining
Engliſh over the head of the Veſſel into the boat.
Thus were we all Strip'd, the Veſſel Plunder'd in a mo-
ment, which they did reſolve to have ſunk, becauſe they
were too farr at Sea diſtant from their own coaſt, but Imme-
diatly we ſaw five ſail bearing down upon us, which ſtartled
the Moors, putting them into a great fright, obliging them
to quit my Veſſel with abundance of Beaf and three Boxes
of dry goods aboard, which their fear would not §
leaſure to rummage for : In ſome ſmall time the five Veſſels
diſcover'd us, when they came within two Leagues of us,
had they bore down afterwards with that reſolution, that
they threatned before, the Pirate would never have ſtood to
look them in the face; but alaſs like diſtraćted fearful game,
every of the five Ships took a ſeveral courſe, and being now
night they all eſcaped. - -
After that we cruiſed about thirty Leagues to the Weſt of
the Northern Cape, and ſo to the Burlings, but no nearer than
Twenty Leagues to the ſhoar, and therefore I imagin there
is more ſafety for ſmall veſſels bound that way, to keep the
ſhore as near as is poſſible, for I know certainly they never

i am likewiſe pretty well ſatisfied for that ſmall time that I
was amongſt them, altho' it was too long for my profit) that:
no sa/grin will fight a Ship of Ten Guns, which I found
true by obſervation of a County-man from Briſtol, whilſt I
was aboard : We came up with him and hail'd him, and
would have had him put out his Boat, but he refuſed, and
withal ſhew’d himſelf ready in his own defence, upon which
we were glad to leave him. -
So that to ſatisfie all my Country-men who follow my
trade I dare confidently affirm, that if I had a Ship of Ten
Guns, and it ſhould be my fortune to encounter any of theſe
Sa/e-rogues, ( who all go under the notion of Algerines,
who are now at peace with England, I would encourage him
to ſend his boat, by acquainting him that our Maſter would
come aboard and ſhew his paſs, (which is the thing they aim
at) And when the boat was come to my ſide, (any man of
reaſon may judge then whether ſhe were from Sa/é or Al-
giers, but however I would commit nothing ſhould be judg-
ed a breach of the Peace, 'twixt Fngland and Algiers ) I
would heave in a Grapling and ſecure the men, all ſave two,
whom I would permitt to return aboard and bring me a Chri-
ſtian, or elſe aver my Paſs, if they will not do that, I am
then ſatisfied what he is, and think my ſelf obliged to de-
fend my ſelf from Slavery, but this I am very confident of,
that he will never ſtay to diſpute the caſe afterward.
. . About a fortnight after I was taken, we met one Samael
Crampton who came from Faro, and whom we ſoon took
without any reſiſtance. The week following we took a ſmalf
Ketch come from Cales, laden with Sherry and Raiſins and
bound for Limrick, john Elliot Maſter. - -

the Pirate, in all Thirty ſeven; We who were newly taken
were kept in Irons in the Hold. --. . .
After the taking of theſe Three Veſſels the Pirate made
all the ſail he could for Sallé to ſave the ſpring Tide, which
flows at Sallé and Mamora S S W about Thirty Leagues:
To the Northward of Sallé, we met a Fleming who came
from Salle, and told our Commander that the Engliſh-men
of War were at Tangier then, attending Captain Nicholaſon,
which cauſed us to bear direétly for Sallé and fell in dircétly
with the Caſtle, where were no Engliſh-men of War, ac-
cording to the Advice.
On the Bar of Sallé there run a great Sea, which obliged
us to come to an Anchor near the Bar,where we rid Six hours;
then were we poor Chriſtians all let looſe from our Iron-
ſhackles, wherein we had been confin'd for Twenty days
preceeding: the Captain ſent the Boat, as near the Shore to
the South of the Bar, as poſſibly he could, to enquire what
News, there they were acquainted that they might, ſafely
come in the next high Water: whilſt the Boat was gone a
Shore, the Moors, we obſerv'd, fell all faſt a ſleep, the Cap-
tain alſo, with his Head over the Rail, upon the half-Deck
ſeem'd deeply ingag’d: This opportunity me thought was
very inviting, I made a propoſal of it to my fellow Slaves,
and undertook to do the Captains buſineſs my ſclf: The
Chriſtians were forward enough to comply with the motion,
and Eleven of the Twelve, (which were Slaves retain’d in
the Ship before our being taken they alſo were willing,if the
Twelfth who was Steward in the Ship would have conſented,
but this ſneaking varlet prov’d recreant, and for fear of him.
the other Eleven turn’d alſo Renegadoes to this Heroick and
Chriſtian reſolution; I had a mind to have diſpatcht this
troubler of our peace out of the way firſt, but the fear that

civility from the Moors than him. - - . .
At four in the Afternoon, we weighed Anchor,and ſtood in
for the Bar, we ſtruck Twicegoing over, but without any dam:
mage; it was upon the Firſt day of November, after we had
helped to moor our Ship, at Night we were all carried aſhore,
and conveyed to our Lodging, which was an old Stable, but
without Litter or Straw, having nothing ſave the bare dirty
Ground for our Bed or Pillow; the next Day we were alk
carryed aboard the Ship to Unrigg her, and get out her Bal-
laſt, which we did; abott Four in the Afternoon, I was ſent for
aſhore to come to the Governour, who paſſed his ſentence on
us Three Maſters, that we ſhould go to his Houſe, and there
remain,until wewere ſent for by the King; we remained at his
HouſeTen days,where our daily employment was to Grind the
Corn for the uſe of his Family; at length there came an Order
for us, and all the reſt of the Chriſtians to be carryed to the
King, whoſe Ordinary and then Reſidence was at Machaneſs,a
place which this preſent Emperour has ſet his Fancy upon, and
beſtows moſt of his care, and employs all Chriſtian Slaves in
Building there; it is diſtant from Saſſé about Seventy Miles,
and from Fez Thirty. "
In our Journy thither, I cannot forget our Captains extra-
ordinary civility, in Accommodatingus ſometimes with Bor-
ricoes to ride on, ſo that in Two days and a half we arrived:
thither: The Firſt night we were not brought before our great
Maſter, but the following our Captain preſented us before
him, and withal ſome Portugueſe Plate, which was taken,
in Mr.Crampton's Veſſel; as the Captain gave it into his Hand,
the ſurly Tyrant with a ſeeming ſcorn and diſdain heav'd it
againſt the Wall, which was the firſt Aétion I obſerv'd, and
did a little diſcover the temper of my new Patron Muley Iſº-
mael Emperour of Morocco and Fez, &c. He ordered us to
be ſent amongſt the reſt of our fellow Slaves; as we went we

were entertain'd with the civilities of the place, and wel-
comed by the joyfull acclamations and complements of the
Moors kicking and ſlapping us all along, which appeared
very uncouth to me, who was but a Stranger, but that Night
my fellow Captives allayed my wonder, by acquainting me,
that what had paſt was nothing, it was only a ſutable Pro-
logue to all the Tragical ſufferings that Chriſtians muſt en-
dure there whilſt they are Slaves, which were ſo dreadful, that
. I could willingly, that very Night have ventured my Life
to endeavour an eſcape; they Painted out to me the Tyran-
nical humour of the Emperour, both towards the Chriſtians
and Natives, in ſuch Bloudy Colours, viz, how they had ſeen
him Butcher many Thouſands with his own hands, how that
none can be ſecure in his preſence for that the varying of a
look, a ſmall ſpot in the Garment, or any ſuch inconſiderable
circumſtance, will raiſe ſuch a caprice in the Emperours Nod-
dle, without any other provocation, as to endanger all the
Heads before him, and it is very rare if the company eſcape
with One or Two only Beheaded, or Lanced through the
Bodv. -

Seven and twenty Negroes one after another, and every Day

through cuſtom, to him Natural Barbarities, Killing and
Dragging, but this latter is a picce of reſpect obſerved only
to Minions and Favourites, Vice-kings and Alcaids; yea his
Women are not able by all their Charms to avoid his Fury,
but are more the objećts of his implacable rage than any other

have ſeen and heard of divers Inhumanities and cruelties pra-.

named in compariſon with this Monſter of 4friek, a cºm:
poſition of Gore and Duſt, whom nothing can attone But
humane Sacrifices, and to be in whoſe court it is much more
eligible to be his Horſe or his Mule, than to be his Privado
or wife of his boſome, from whoſe greateſt kindneſs my
good God ever defend me,for his mercies are cruel: Yeaeyen
Hamed Ben Haddu who was his Embaſſadour here in England
Three years ago, altho' he was received and entertain'd here
with extraordinary civilities, and carreſs'd every where by all
the endearments of kindneſs and reſpect, and altho' by his
fineneſs and Mooriſh ſubtilty, he ſtole into the Inclinations
of the well-meaning and good natur'd Engliſh, ſo that he
obtain'd the reputation of Ingenuity and candour, Yet the
Dog has return'd to his Vomit, and by woful experiment, all
my Country-men, who come under his power, find him a
harſh and cruel Maſter, who manag’d his affairs here with
deep diſſimulation, and now improves his knowledge of Eng-
liſh affairs, to the detriment and ruin of all the Kings Sub-
jećts, with whom he has to do; if it be his fortune to meet
or paſs by any of them, his cuſtom is (as all the Engliſh can
atteſt) to ſalute them with a deviliſh Curſe to the beſt of
my remembrance expreſt thus, Aſli Haztebuck, i.e. God
roaſt your Father: he is indeed reckoned a great Maſter in
the art of Diffimulation and Flattery, a †. which
ſeems very requiſite in a Courtier of ſuch a Barbarous Bloody
Tyrant as his Maſter is. -
But to proceed, my fellow Chriſtians in the next place,
ſhewed me the ſtaff of their life there, i.e. their Bread,
which was of Barley,but black, and withalit ſtunk, the Corn
being kept Seven years under Ground before us'd, one Days

diſſatisfied and very weary of my condition, and therefore I
did often rummage all my thoughts, for ſome expedient to
eaſe me of this accurſed way, not of Living, but Starving
and Dying daily: My mind did often flatter me with the

fident I was, that I diſcovered my intentions to ſeveral
Chriſtians, eſpecially to thoſe of my near acquaintance, who
by no means could be induc’d to hear the difficulties and
dangers that attended ſuch a reſolution: In the mean time
my Friends in England had taken ſome care for my Ran-

Merchant in Bárbary, to endeavour my relief if One hun-
dred and fifty Pounds would effe&b it, which Sum Mr. Lud.

the poor Spirited Chriſtians, and baniſhed all ſuch reſoluti-
ons quite out of their minds: At length I opened my mind
to Mr. Baxter (who about a Year and a half before, had
made an unlucky attempt to run away, but being brought
back he had the Baſtinado in ſuch a ſort that he could not
work ſor a Twelve Month, having Irons continually upon
his Leśgs) but notwithſtanding, ſuch was his love of Chri-
ſtian Liberty, that he freely told me, that he would adven-
ture with any fair opportunity; after I had him thus engag'd
by his promiſe, I gave him no reſt, until we had pitch'd upon
a Day; we alſo took into our Cabal and ſhare of our For-
tunes, Two Briſtol-men, who were ready at an hours war-
ning, when we appointed.
There are at Machaneſ; at preſent about Eight hundred
Chriſtians of all Nations, Two hundred and ſixty whereof
are Engliſh, ſeveral of which have tendred Mony for their
Ranſom, ſome Seven hundred, ſome Five hundred pieces of
Eight, ſome more, ſome leſs, but the King ſtill put them off
with this, that he would clear none particularly, but that
they ſhould go all together. -
january the Firſt, The King ſet forward towards Santa
Cruz,with an Army of about Sixty thouſand men, deſigning to
quel his Nephew, who had made a formidable Inſurrečtion
againſt him, in that part of his Dominions: We Chriſtians
could not Inform our ſelves of the certain proceedings of theſe
Armies, neither did we much care, fight Dog, fight Bear,
but this we learnt, that it will be Two or Three years before
his return, and it is not to be ſuppos'd that any particular
Chriſtian will be releas'd until he return; beſides, there is
no hopes to be laid upon the moſt ſolemn word and proteſta-
tion of this ſwarthy Infidel Muley Iſmael, for, as I have
becm inform’d, about Four or Five years ago, by an agree-
ment with Collonel Kirk, all the Engliſh ſlaves were to be

head, and the bargain was ſo far ſtruck, that the Chriſtians
were got a Mile out of Town, But the accurſed Jews, (the
ſtench and peſt of the Nations of the Earth, Malicious to
all Man-kind and loathſome and abominable whereever they
come, who not only have the blood of the Saviour of the
World lying upon their heads, but are acceuntable for the
blood of many Thouſands of his Members which they daily
ſhed). Theſe wicked Enemies of Chriſtianity, brought back
theſe poor Chriſtians into the houſe of bondage thus, they
proffered the Emperour as much mony as the King of Eng-
land rendred for the Chriſtians Ranſome, if ſo be he would
only lend them for a while, to build a City for the Jews, and
then they ſhould be reſtor'd to the King? The covetous Ty-
rant ſoon clos'd with theſe advantageous terms, and the Chri-
ans were turn'd over to the Jews, who imploy'd them Three
years in building a City, but when finiſh'd, ſee the juſt Judg-
ment of God!The Jews were turn'd out,and forc'd to give place
to the Moors: Another remarkable ſtory concerning the Jews
I cannot but inſert upon this occaſion : About Three years
ago, Mr. Bowrey of Briſtol was, with Twenty ſail more,
taken by the Sallé-men, Bowrey had a parcel of Soap in his
Ship, which then did belong to the King; Ben Haddu Am-
baſſadour in England deſir'd to buy this Soap of the King,
but a Jew out bid him, and ſo had the Soap, for which dea.
ling the Ambaſſador kept a grudge in his mind againſt the
Jews, and was reveng'd on them, after this manner, whilſt
I was there. He inform'd the King that the Jews had im-
pos'd upon him and couzen'd him of Fifty thouſand pieces of
Eight in the matter of the Soap, upon which the King clapt
up Ten of the chief Jews in Priſon, until they ſhould either
pay the ſaid Sum, or elſe reſtore the Soap, which it is to be
ſuppoſed, hath been ſold in Chriſtendom Two years ago.

exeus’d from work that day, we went there fore to the Town

before him, and coming near the houſe, we diſcover'd about
Twenty Moors ſitting there; which accident of being hem-
ed in behind and before by theſe our cnemies, put us into
a great fright, and had in all likely hood ſpoil'd our deſign,
in the very entrance, if providence had not preſented to
our view, on one ſide of the houſe, a parcel of Lime-kills, to
which, without the Moors obſervation we immedially ſtruck
up, where we abſconded our ſelves by lying flat upon our
bellies; about half an hour after came two Mooriſh women
thither, to gather up ſome looſe wood, we confidering it
very inconvenient to ſhew our ſelves fearful, leſt 'we ſhould

broke clear, we ſaw abundance of Cattle graſing in the
bottom, with Moors,who lookt after them,but, by Gods pro-
vidence, none came near us, ſo that we lay ſafe all that day,
being the laſt day of May.
At night we ſet forwards, keeping the Woods, where .
were no Mooriſh Inhabitants, only wild beaſts, the leſs ſa-
vage and formidable, which we often ſaw, but they never
attempted to come near us, we travel'd about Ten miles
that night, and then croſſed a River, which ſupplied us with
Water, whereof we were in want; on the other ſide of the
River, we obſerv'd the footſteps of a great many Cattle,
which rendred the place, as we ...; unſafe for us, we
made therefore a little further progreſs in the morning, to
the top of the Hill, where under a large Oak we found a buſh
convenient for our reception that day, but within a little
while we were diſturb in our repoſe, obſerviñg the Cattle to
come graſing up the Hill, directly to that buſh, with Moors
at their heels, with all haſt therefore we pact up our luggage
and ran a mile further, without being diſcover'd, until we
came to a Pear tree, furniſh'd with long-graſs a round him,
there we took up our quarters all that day, being the Firſt
of June.
The night following, we intended to proceed, but it plea-
ſed God, to ſtrike melame with the Gout, ſo that I was not
able to ſtand, I was forced therefore to remain there all that
night, and the day .# which was a great hindrance
to my companions, and afflićtion to my ſelf: The readieſt
expedient to remedy my diſtemper, which I could think upon
was this, we made a fire in a hole in the ground, and I put
my Foot into the hole to draw away the pain, having alſo a
Lancet with us, I endeavour'd to breath a Wein in my Foot,
but I could not effect it, for the Lancet would not enter,
however, I found ſome eaſe by the force of the fire: My
company being ſenſible of the delay, which my diſtemper
occaſion'd,

occaſion'd, began to be mov’d, inſomuch that they told me,
that if I could not march with them that night, they muſt
hold themſelves oblig'd to take leave of me, which added
a great afflićtion to my ſorrow, inſomuch as I was the Au-
thor and firſt mover of this eſcape; That I might not there-
fore be forſaken by my companions, and in compliance to
their importunity, I reſolved to ſtrain my outmoſt power.
The third of june at night I endeavoured to go, but in
great pain, ſo that we could not proceed above Three miles,
when I was forc'd to pray my Companions to ſtay but that
night, and I did not queſtion, but by Gods bleſſing, to be
able to travel with them the next, they conſented, and ſo
we took up our lodging for the remainder of that night,
under another Pear-tree. . . " . .
... The fourth of jane I kept baking my foot all the day in
the Ground, till about two in the Afternoon, in the mean
while, I procur'd Mr. Baxter to make me a wooden Leg,
which accordingly he did, I perſwaded them, then, to tra-
vel about . Three or Four miles that afternoon, which would
a little eaſe the labour of the night, they agreed, I travel'd
about Four miles with that Leg, and then reſted till night on
the top of a high Hill, whence we ſaw a great plain valley
before us.
At night we ſhap'd our courſe clear of the Tents, and tra-
vel'd over the edge of the plain, about Six miles; We paſt
by ſeveral fields of corn, the Moors in the mean time hallow-
ing to frighten the wild beaſts from them: Croſſing of a Ri-
vºr that night, we ſaw and heard ſeveral Lyons, ſome ap-
‘proach'd ſo near that we could almoſt have touch'd them,but
as ſoon as we ſtrook fire, which we had prepar'd for that very
purpoſe, they preſently vaniſh'd; when the light began to
diſplay itſelf, we took our quarters for the next day, which
was june the Fifth ; At night we continued our courſe,

hard to get Eight miles that night : By reſting the next da

3ame the Sixth, We ſet onward, and meaſur'd Ten miles
that night, when we came to a great Swamp, there my
pain renewing, I fain would have perſwaded them to ſtay
but by no intreaties could perſwade them, ſo reſolving to
part, we ſhar'd our Bread, which came to two half Rusksa
peice; I endeavour'd to allure my weak wearied Brother to
abide with me, comforting him with the expectation of Gar-
dens, where we two more eaſily than the company of Four,
might provide for our ſelves; He would not ſtay; Being
reſt thus with the conſideration of being left alone, I Re.

became perfectly whole and clear of the Gout;. That night
we travel'd over a high barren Hill, where we fancied we
heard the Suſs and noiſe of the Sea, which encourag'd us to
mend our pace until we met with a Garden, where we ga-
ther'd about a dozen of ſmall Pumpkins, a very comforta-
ble aſſiſtance to us, now that our Bread was all ſpent, for
ſome we eat raw, and ſome we roaſted in the ground, where-
by we found our ſelves conſiderably refreſht; That night we
made no more then Eight miles, for meeting with a great
Oak which was blown down, we thought it inconvenient to
overſlip ſuch an advantageous retirement for the next day,
which we were the more deſirous off, becauſe we heard a
great many Moors, tho' we could not ſee them,
All the next day we lay ſtill and with exceeding content-
ment we heard the noiſe of the Sea, at night we put on and
came to the ſhoar, where we found whereabout we then
were, viz. to the Southward of Mamora, we dºg †

Courſe then Northward for Two miles, when we could di-
ſcern the Caſtle, but knowing that we could not go to the
northward of the Caſtle, becauſe the great River goes di-
rectly up into the Country, we turn'd back about a mile, and
finding a convenient buſh, we reſted there all the next day,
hearing and ſeeing a great many Cattle, but none came near
US.
fune the Eighth, we gathered about half a Peck of Snailes,
and caught a Land-Tortois, which we roaſted and eat har-
tily, that day alſo, we ſaw a Ship in the Offing, when night
was come, we made down towards the Caſtle, and before
we were aware we fell upon a Moor making a fire, which
forc'd us to draw back, the Moor not diſcerning us, we fetcht
then a compaſs, and by another way came down to the
Caſtle, there we found a ſtrong watch, which did wholly
diſcourage our expe&tations of relief from that place, ſo we
ſet up our Reſolutions for Salé, about Eighteen or Twenty
miles to the Southward, to ſee what good could be done
there, But before we parted with Mamora, we made bold
with a little Barley and Guinny corn, growing under the
Caſtle, of each whereof we gathered about a quarter of a
Peck, to ſerve our neceſſities, and then we betook our ſelves to
our former nights refuge, the Buſh, and after having conſulted
how to ſteer our courſe for Salé, the reſult whereof was a
long the Sea-ſide, we reſted all the next day without diſtur-
bance. -
june the Ninth, We travel'd along the Sea-ſide, where we
ſaw a great deal of Raft-timber, we concluded therefore,
ſeeing the Ship in the Offing, to make a Raft, which accor-
dingly we did, and put off with it, but it would not ſwim,
boyart with us all, we came therefore a ſhore, and cut all
our Laſhings, leaving it to the mercy of the Sea : We tra-

our company, made over to the South-fide of the River, to
ſee what purchaſe we could make there, we found indeed
Three boats, but they were all aground, ſo that we could
do no good with them ; But in ſearching about the new
Ships, which Five in number are building there) we found
two Qares, with which we ſwam over to our conſorts, and

all together we went down by the Rivers ſide, to the
bours mouth, but we could meet with no boat to put our
Oares in ; We ſaw two Dutch-men in the River, but they
kept a diligent watch, which hindred us from carrying away
their boat ; We concluded therefore to bury our Garts in
the ſand at ſome remarkable place, and ſo we betook our
ſelves to find out a ſanétuary for the day following; We found
a Fig-tree full of leaves, in an unlrequented place, as we
thought, on the North-ſide of the River, yet within call of

ſtood off, and at length ſaw us, we pull'd aboard, and found
her to be the Lark-Friggot Captain Leighton Commander;
after ſome Examination and Diſcourſe about the Methods

was this, that if he would accommodate me with his Boat,
and thoſe belonging to the other Two Men of War, which
were in Company, I would undertake to Pilot them in, and
to buro what Ships were then at Mamora; The Captain im-
mediately ſtood to the Northward, and came up with the
other Two Ships, which were the Bonaventure and the Gray-
hound; The Admiral was then Sick at Cales, ſo Captain

Captain Prieftman, who was Sick as aboveſaid, they held a
Council about thoſe propoſitions which I had made; at firſt
they ſeemed unpraćticable, by reaſon of many difficulties,
but eſpecially of the Bar, which is worſe than that of Saúč;
but then when upon Second thoughts they conſidered the
forwardneſs of Men, who but that very Day had eſcapt a
heavy Slavery, and yet were willing that very Night to en-
gage in the action, they concluded it both poſſible and fea-
#. ſo they entertain'd with approbation what I had pro-
pos'd ; After which I immediately return'd with Captain
Ileighton aboard the Lark, and communicated the reſult of
the Council with my Comrade Mr. Baxter, who was heartily
pleas'd with what was undertaken, and willing to go along,
ſo he was ordered to go in the Bonaventure's Boat, and was
very ſerviceable, and who was better acquainted with that
Bar, than I was. Immediately orders were given to ſhave
ſome Deal-boards, and ſaw ſome Tarr-barrels, and make rea-
dy with all expedition; by Seven at Night, all things were
in readineſs, the Friggots were riding Two Leagues from
Shore, orders were given that the Boat in which I was, viz.
the Gray-hound's, ſhould go a head, Commanded by Captain
Macdonald, who behaved himſelf indeed with great Courage
and Reſolution, and the reſt had orders to follow us; there
were Three Barges in all, and one Yawl, the number of Men

from the Ships, and betwixt Nine and Ten, we fell a little

we quickly righted our ſelves, and found the Bar; there
