A NARRATIVE
OF THE
Captivity and Suffering's
OF
MARIA MARTIN,
WHO WAS SIX YEARS A SLAVE IN.
ALGIERS.
I AM a native of England, and was
born in the year 1779, of respectable and
wealthy parents. In the year 1797, I was
married to captain Henry Martin, who
was commander of one of the East India
Company's ships. Being ever desirous
of visiting some distant part of the world,
I solicited and obtained the consent of
my husband to accompany him a voyage
to Minorca. Accordingly, on the twen.
tieth of June 1800, we set sail in the ship
Unicorn, on board of which there were
one hundred souls, twelve of whom were
passengers. We enjoyed for several
weeks a pleasant wind, and nothing oc-
curred to obstruct our passage until the

27th July, when at the very moment that
the soft breeze fanned every soul to sleep,
when every fear of danger was banished,
all care forgotten, and the wearied lulled
in the arms of Morpheus to sweet repose,
then, in an instant, we were all roused,
by the striking of the ship upon a rock.!
Our amazement and horror cannot be dea
scribed in order to do it, the reader must
realize my feelings at that moment. We
were soon overwhelmed by the tempest
of the sea.
The crew were in the ut.
most confusion-some swearing, and
others praying.
At day light next morning, we found
ourselves in a deplorable situation, the
ship on her beam ends, with four feet of
water in her hold, and a heavy sea conți-
nually breaking over uş. In order to
lighten the vessel, the foremast was cut
away, and the guns thrown overboard,
this plan had its desired effect, for in a
few minutes we found ourselves afloat in
deep water, and saw astern of us, the rock
that had caused us so much trouble and
anxiety of mind. All hands being im-
mediately, set to work in repairing and

clearing the ship of water, we had the
pleasure of seeing ourselves the follow-
ing day in a situation to proceed on our
voyage.
Nothing from this moment transpired,
worthy of record, until the 14th of Au.
gust, when we met with a far more fatal
disaster ; about sun-set, we were alarm-
ed at the sight of a vessel we discovered,
which Capt. Martin imagined to be a
French frigate, and to avoid her, he al-
tered the ship's course ; the wind at this
moment began to blow unusually strong,
and with the night increased to a hurri.
cane. The night was extremely dark,
and the sea running high and breaking
over us, rendered it impossible to keep a
light in the binnaclewe were therefore
obliged to lash the helm and trust to the
mercy of the waves. At day light the
storm began in some measure to abate-
at 9 A. M. it entirely subsided. :::
At 2 P. M. as we were taking some re-
freshment in the cabin, the boatswain
came and told my busband that the co-
lour of the water had changed; upon
which he reprinianded him, and told him

tinued our course under a foresail; but
our terror and surprise was not to be
expressed, when in the morning watch,
my husband being upon deck, discovered
land right a-head, he came down imme-
diately into the cabin, and with tears in
his eyes, desired I would arise. By his
countenance I judged that something ex.
traordinary was the matter ; I instanily
arose and went upon deck, and plainly
saw the land but a short distance a-head !
The land had the appearance of sand-
hanks, and the ship's crew did all they
could to weather them, but the ship
having a round head, she would not obey
the helm, therefore it was agreed to make
in for the land, hoping, as it had the ap-
pearance of a bold shore, that we might,
through Providence, land safe. It how-
ever proving ebb: tide, the ship struck
upon one of the banks, but by lightening
the ship, and cutting away her masts by
the board, got clear of that; but keeping

still in for the shore, we soon after struck
upon another sand bank, but not very
violently, so we threw out our ship's an-
chors in hopes we might ride out the
tide ; but the wind increasing, we dragged
them, and were violently thrown upon
another sand bank, where the ship stuck,
and the waves dashed over us, There
were several children on board, the dis-
mal cries of whom at this awful moment,
could not fail to pierce the hardest heart.
Capt. Martin ordered the boat out, to
see if we could gain the shore that way,
a number jumped into her, but ere they
could leave the ship, she was stayed to
pieces.
There were on board two blacks, that
were excellent divers, (for the surge was
so violent no one could stem the billows
but by diving) who offered to get with a
rope on shore, and fasten it from the ship
to the rocks. The negroes accordingly
plunged into the sea, and in a few mo.
ments we had the satisfaction to see them
land and make fast the rope, by the as-
sistance of which they again returned to
the ship. My husband, the mate and

myself ventured into the water first, upan
the awning of the ship, and got safe on
shore. The captain's clerk, the boat-
swain, and two sailors next came on
shore, but no sooner were they landed,
than the rope broke, and as the two ne,
groes had left us, all hopes of saving any
more from the ship was at an end ; alas!
my ears are even pierced at this moment
with their cries, which was more terrible
to me than the storm.
Soon after our arrival on shore, my hus.
band, the mate and boatswain, went in
search of inhabitants, but in a few hours
returned, and informed me that they
could not discover any ; our grief was
now renewed, for we were apparently in
as much danger of starving now, as we
had been of drowning a few hours be-
fore.
While we were lamenting our condi-
tion, we heard somebody hollow, up in
the woods, which revived our drooping
senses ; but running to see who it was,
we, much to our grief, found it to be one
of ihe sailors that escaped, who was hol-
lowing to his companion.

When we were together, my husband
proposed that we should walk to the
southward, to see if it were possible to
find any inhabitants ; but in less than an
hour, our journey was obstructed by an
impenetrable wood, and we were com-
pelled to return. We then steered our
course northward, but were interrupted
by large swamps. Thus marooned as we
were, we went back again, and could per-
ceive the poor wretches in the vessel
liſting up their hands to us for succour.
Capt. Martin made signs to them to let
them know that our condition was as bad
as theirs. I growing near night, some
of the poor creatures ventured into the
water, but were soon drowned. In short,
every object we beheld increased our hors
None of us had eat or drank for
two days. My poor husband though
quite cast down himself, endeavoured to
cheer his fellow-sufferers; and that we
might be sheltered from the inclemency
of the night (which to add to our wretch-
ed condition, proved a rainy one) the
men by joint consent and labour while
the day lasted, collected a great number

and almost expiring with thirst. In the
in the morning, by my request, we ad-
dressed ourselves to the all-seeing Power
for succour. After our extempore ori.
sons were over, we rose up and resolved
to go into the woods, to gather if possible,
something to kill our hunger. We did
not travel far before the mate, who was a
little way a-head, came running toward
us, and told us that he had discovered a
few rods distant, a number of men of a
very tawny complexion, armed with long
spears; we did not hesitate a moment to
meet then, whether friends or foes, for
we felt ourselves unable any longer to
live without focd. As soon as they dis-
covered us, they advanced towards us in

füll speed; when within hail, they ac-
costed us in a language which we did not
understand ; ny husband addressed them
in English and then in French, but they
did not appear to understand what he
said, the mate then addressed them in
Spanish, but with no better success--one
of the sailors who had been a prisoner
among the Moors, next addressed them
in the Moresco language, and by one or
two of them appeared to be understood,
who, in reply, declared us " their pri.
soners.' By the request of my husband,
the sailor, who had now become our in-
terpreter, enquired the name of the coun.
try in which we were the reply was,
“you are in Barbary, 30 miles from Te.
nis, and 90 from the city of Algiers.
We were at this instant surrounded
by the barbarians, who brandishing their
spears, commanded us to follow them.
The sailor told them that we were British
subjects, with whom the Bey of Algiers
was at peace ; to this, however, they paid
little or no attention, but compelled us to
accompany them. About sun-set, we
arrived at Mostago, a village 27 miles

from Tenis, where we tarried that night,
and the next morning proceeded for Oran,
The news of our arrival was soon made
known, and the inhabitants collected in
great numbers to view us.-By our inter-
preter we discovered that those by whom
we were captured, were representing us
as natives of Portugal, that we were part
of the crew of a privateer of that na-
tion, which had been shipwrecked on
their coast. As the Portuguese were then
at war with no nation but the Algerines;
the wicked lie of these unprincipled bar-
barians had its desired effect, and so en-
raged the multitude, that they could hard-
ly be restrained from laying violent hands
on us.
It appeared to be the policy of our cap.
tors to represent us as an enemy, as they
well knew that we should be disposed of
ås such, and that they, agreeable to a law
of their country, would be entitled to one
half of the purchase money—but, to the
contrary, had it been known that we were
British subjects, the English consul at
Algiers would have demanded us as such.


## p. 69 (#75) ##############################################

69
My husband's greatest concern was,
that we should be disposed of to different
persons, and separated, never perhaps to
see each other again, and too soon were
his expectations verified, for the day after
our arrival, we were drove up like so many
cattle which are to be exposed for sale, to
the public market, where were gathered
a great number of bidders ; among them
I recognized many of my own sex, which
gave me fresh hopes of protection, but,
alas ! this fond hope was of but short du.
ration, for so far from exhibiting any pity
for me, they seemed rather to exult in
my miseries! One of the ruffians who
claimed me as their property, conducted
me to the Cadi, or principal governor of
the place, who was a little, ugly, old look-
ing man, besmeared with dirt, barefoot
and bare legged, to him I was recom-
mended as a valuable in-door slave ; he
was very critical in the examination of
my person ; my limbs, teeth, eyes, &c.
were very closely inspected. Afier un-
dergoing a thorough examination by more
than one hundred different persons, I was
struck off to a Turk; I was then led out

the care of his son, who was seated on a
log a few yards therefrom, awaiting the
departure of his father.
Here for the first time I had a melan.
choly view of my unhappy fellow slaves,
whose countenances, as they stole a pity-
ing glance toward me, bespoke more
than the tongue can express! they were
employed in their daily occupation, which
was to load large carts with rocks and
huge stones blown from the ledges near
the shore, and to convey them to a valley
about one mile distant; those employed
to load the carts, had large collars about
their necks, made much after the form
of those worn by the West-India slaves;
those allotted to draw the carts, were
chained thereto. To witness the dis-
tress, and to hear the despairing groans
of those poor creatures, could not fail to
draw a tear from the eye of any one but
a merciless barbarian ! Under the heavy
weight of the lash, they were compelled
to perform the severest tasks; half naked,
their scorched and lacerated bodies exhi.
bited a frightful proof of the brutality

exercised toward them by those merciless
barbarians.
A very great portion of the inhabitants
of Tenis are Moors, a description of the
manners and customs of which
may
be
entertaining to my readers. They are
of a tawny complexion, of a lazy, idle
disposition, and addicted to all the vices
of mankind ; mistrustful to the last de
gree, false, jealous, and the very picture
of ignorance. They stile themselves
musselmen, or true believers ; yet their
word is not to be relied on. They
abominate the christians, for the very
word in their language signifies dog; and
are continually seeking means to destroy
them." Mahomet has taught them in
his Alcoran, that all who die fighting
agai. st christiants, immediately enter in
to paradise, in triumph"; nay, even their
houses, if they die in battle, are immedi-
ately translated into heaven.
Though poligamy is allowed, yet they
must marry but four wives, and must
settle a dowry upon them; they are
strictly forbidden marrying or having ans
intercourse with a christian woman ; those

er, which as they repeat, they drop through
their fingers. The prayer consists only
in the different attributes of God, as
God is great, God is good, God is infi-
nite, God is merciful.
The Cadi (or Governor) of Tenis, only
differs from his subjects in a larger pro-
pensity to their ill qualities, with the ad-
dition of a degree of cruelty and avarice.
I was one day a spectator to his wanton
cruelty ; having been sent on some errand
by my Turkish master, I perceived him
giving directions to some of his workmen;
there were scveral carts drove by his

73
slaves, with materials for his house, and
as they passed him he bastinadoed some
for going too fast, while others, thinking
to mend that fault, were drubbed by him
for going too slow ; one poor creature,
trembling for fear what would follow,
went bowing before his cart, but the
Cadi, wounding his horse in the flank, he
gave a spring, tumbled the poor wretch
down and drove over him. Another
following him, ran to assist his fellow
creature, but the Cadi threw his dart and
struck him in the shoulder; the slave
drew it out, and upon his knees present-
ed it to him again, which the Cadi (when
the man had got a little distance from.
him) darted the second time into his
body! The poor creature drew it out
once more, and, covered with blood,
gave it to him back again, but as he was
stooping, he fell down with loss of blood
at the barbarian's feet, who did him the
favour to pin him to the earth through his
back.
The Cadi is said to possess a great
deal of wit and courage, is very active
and expert in riding and hurling the dart.

much addicted to women, having no less
than four hundred concubines.
The Moors shave their heads close, ex-
cept one lock upon the crown of their
heads, which they never cut off, they
being taught that by that lock Mahomet
is to draw them up to their imaginary
paradise.
I could not forbear smiling to see the
policy practised by the Moors in one in-
stance ; walking one day about a mile
from Tenis, after my release from capti-
vity, it began to rain violently, I got un-
der a tree to shelter myself from the tem-
pest, but I observed several of the Moors
undress themselves with a great deal of
precipitancy, make up their clothes in a
bundle, and sit on them stark naked ;
this was to prevent their being wet, while
their naked bodies were exposed to the
fury of the storm. When it ceased to

bodies were dry, and then dressed them.
selves,
The dress of the Moors chiefly consists
of a robe or caften of serge, woolen stuff,
or blue and white cotton, and sometimes,
but very seldom, of silk. They are
also clothed in a shirt, which is tied round
the neck, and is so wide as to fold two
or three times about the body ; this is
bound round the waist by a sash, in which
is stuck a long knife like a bayonet, and
sometimes two. The dress of both the
men and women consists of such a large
shirt, generally of black linen, and a cloth
with which the women cover their head
and shoulders; the men sometimes roll-
ing it about their heads, in imitation of
a turban, and sometimes round the mid.
dle. Some of the women wear their hair
tied up in a knot, and others let it hang
down ; but the men are in general very
negligent about it. They wear sandals,
or rather socks, of Morocco leather,
which raise to the small of the leg; and
their heads are covered with a red bon.

long lo se robe of white or striped cotton,
or woolen stuff, above described, which
they frequently wear over their capacious
shirt, they call halk, and is extremely be-
coming. This robe has a long pointed
hood that falls down behind, to the ex-
tremity of which hangs a tassel by a long
string. However, the pour are clothed
after the manner of the negroes.
The women, as I before mentioned,
wear a long cotton shift ; this has long
and wide sleeves; they have likewise
large drawers, and a piece of calico, or
linen, that covers them from head to foot,
and flows in an easy manner behind.
They are all adorned with ear-rings and
pendants, which are valuable in propor-
tion to the wearer's station and quality.
When a considerable number of tents
or cabins are placed together, and form a
kind of town or village, they call it
Adouar. These villages are usually of
a circular form, the tents standing very
thick, and in the centre is an empty
space in which they keep their cattle.
They have centinels on every side of this

and unnecessary their excursions may be,

inactivity as highly culpable.

larges itself in proportion to its length,
which is sometimes above thirty feet.
In some parts of the country the peo.
ple it is said have portable mills, with
which they grind their corn as they want
it. Their manner of eating resembles
that of the Asiatics. At their meals they
sit cross-legged round a covering of lea-
ther, or a mat of palm leaves, spread upon
the ground, upon which their dishes or
plates of copper or ivory are laid ; and
they never drink till they rise in order to
wash, a ceremony that cannot be omitted
without the greatest indecency. They
never allow themselves more than two
meals a day, one in the morning and the
other at night, and the women are never
allowed to eat with the men. Their re-
past is short and silent, not a syllable
being uttered till they have washed and
returned to their pipe and coffee, and then
conversation begins.
From this temperance in their meals,
arises that strong health which renders
them strangers to medicine, the study of
which was so much cultivated by their
predecessors.
The only distempers to

and pleurisies, both which they are said
to cure by the internal and external ap-
plication of simples. The inhabitants
are said to live to a great age, without
experiencing what sickness is, seldom
dying before the animal powers are wasted
by years.
With them a man at sixty is

The mothers have a passionate fond-

most care to prevent their being injured
by any accident. The boys are permit-
ted to marry as soon as they can purchase
a wife, which is done by presents to the
parents, of camels, horses, and horned
cattle. They estimate the affection of
the husband from his liberality, and the
young lady is never delivered to him till
by his presents he has made her parents
sensible of his merits. If upon her be-

his expectations of her beauty or chas-
tity, he may send her back ; but in this
case he forfeits the presents he has
made.
A man las no sooner breathed his last,
than one of his women, or some relation,
puts her head in at the door of the tent,
and bursts into a terrible cry ; upon which
all the women within the village set up
a lamentable shriek and dismal screams,
which alarm the whole camp or village.
With respect to the learning of the
Moors, it is so extremely limited, that
few of them are able to read or write ;
yet some of them have a tolerable notion
of astronomy, and talk with precision
upon the stars, their number, situation,
and division into constellations. The
clear and serene sky in which they live,
has greatly assisted their observations,
which advantage they have improved by
arwarm imagination and a happy memo-
ry: their system of astronomy is, how-
ever, so replete with fable and absurdity,
that it is in general difficult to compre-
hend their meaning ; yet with all their

contemptible, seem to indicate.

their music, it might be inferred, that
these people are not very warlike; but if

mous. “Can any thing,” they say, "be
more dastardly, than to kill a man before
you approach him near enough to be dis-
tinquished ?” Hence they never attack
an enemy till they come within the length
of their ances, and then retiring to a pro-
per distance, throw them or shoot their
arrows with surprising dexterity. They
fight chiefly on horseback with short
stirrups, and by raising themselves high
in the saddle, strike with great force.
They never draw up their cavalry in long
lives and extended wings, but in small
detatched squadrons, by which means,
they are less liable to be broke or thrown
into confusion; and when such an acci-
dent happens, are more easily formed.

The cruel oppressions which the Moors
of Tenis suffer wider the tyrannical gov.
ernment of Algiers, have greatly contri.
buted to their degeneracy ; and a more
abject condition than theirs can scarcely
be conceived.
Can we imagine a situation more
adapted to depress the human mind, or
render man completely miserable ? But
it is far from producing these effects :
froni their unparalelled patience, under
these various kinds of what others would
esteem the greatest wretchedness, they
enjoy a tolerable share of happiness.
On seeing a number of these Moors
sitting at the doors of their wretched cots,
half naked, some smoking, and telling
merry tales, others singing or dancing,
one would conclude them to be a happy,
though a lazy people.
There are but few Turks in Tenis,
they are a wretched crew of indigent,
ragged, thievish fellows. These wretches
being furnished with a gun, a sword,
and other arms, are incorporated into
some regiment, and soon obtain a vote
and share in the government ; and from

that situation are raised from one post to
another, till they obtain those of admiral,
vizier, and even bey. The Turks treat
their slaves very barbarously ; at night
they confine them in dungeons, and in
the day time compel them to toil in
chains, and frequently allowing them only
a little bread and water.
Having in the preceding pages mi-
nutely described the manners and cus-
toms of the Moors, who are the principal
inhabitants of Tenis, I shall now proceed
to give a more particular account of my
own sufferings while
among
them.
My Turkish master having completed
his business, after a few moments con-
versation with his son, by whom I had
been guarded, commanded me to arise
and follow him. I was conducted through
several filthy lanes and alleys, which led
to the habitation of my new master---the
house was large and commodious, but
not elegant--he was the possessor of
between forty and fifty christian slaves,
all of whom, except ten, were Portuguese,
nine of the latter were Napoleans, and
one a native of England. I was indeed

84
extremely sorry to find one of my own
countrymen in as deplorable a condition
as myself, yet in him I found a real and
valuable friend, and without the aid and
assistance of whom, I should in all
pro-
bability at this moment have been still
held in bitter captivity.
My unfortunate friend (whose name
was Malcome, and who had been five
years in captivity) informed me that our
master was grand Vizier of the city, and
a great favourite of the then reigning Bey
of Algiers--that he was a blood-thirsty,
cruel and inhuman monster, who, to his
knowledge, had put several of his slaves
to death for no greater fault than that of
complaining of indisposition, and an ina-
bility to perform their daily tasks.
He mentioned several instances where-
in he had been most unmercifully tortur.
ed for attempting to communicate infor-
mation of his captivity, to the English
Consul, at Algiers—his nails had been
torn from his fingers and toes, and his
whole body lacerated in a manner not to
be described. I could not discover one
among the whole number of slaves claim .

Soon after my arrival I was divested

was then conducted into an adjoining

As soon as I entered, I was ordered to
proceed immediately to business ;
had placed over us as overseer, a woman
who if possible, surpassed her employer
in acts of barbarity; she was a native of
Morocco, and seemed to glory in having
it in her power to torture and torment us,
by every means and in every way that her
inventive faculties could give birth to.
The wretch would not unfrequently com-
pel us, for the least offence, io strip our-
selves naked, and then stand for a given
number of minutes within a few feet of a
blazing fire ! --at other times she would
throw hot embers and coals of fire into
our bosoms; and shocking as it may ap-
pear, she in my presence deprived of life
a poor unfortunate girl, by strewing her
naked body with hot rice ! Under the
controul of such a governess, my readers
will acknowledge that my situation must
have been truly wretched ; but, alas !
we were slaves! and to a barbarous and
unprincipled monster, deprived of our

sighs and tears availed nothing, they were
only productive of stripes ! there were
but few among our number but would
have chosen death rather than life.
Confined and employed with the other
slaves, in cooking, &c. as before men-
tioned, nothing worthy of record took
place until about 13 months from the
time of my capture, when the thunder.
ing of cannon announced the approach
of an event of no little magnitude. About
3 o'clock, P. M. orders were received
from the grand Vizier (our master) for us
to repair as soon as possible to a fortifi-
cation at the harbour's mouth; on arriv.
ing at which, we discovered the cause of
the alarm. The Napoleans with a well-
manned fleet of gun-boats, &c. had com.
menced a tremendous cannonade on the
city, and we were ordered here for the
purpose of conveying ammunition to the
besieged, from the magazine, a business
always allotted female captives in time of
action. At half past 7 A.-M. the cannon-
ade became terrible, while all was bustle
and confusion among the besieged ; they

discharged some few cannon against
their assailants, but without doing appa.
rent injury. At 2 P. M. the firing ceased,
but at 4 it again commenced, when red
hot balls were thrown into the city, and
with so good effect, that in a few mo-
ments the castle, together with most of
the public buildings were set on fire,
and the greatest part of the city reduced
to ashes; the slain and wounded were
immense. I was at this moment employ.
ed as I had been during the whole siege,
in furnishing the Algerines with powder,
yet I could have a fair view of what was
going on, and was not a little pleased to
see many of that barbarous nation made
to bite the dust!
The Napoleans having expended all
their powder, and probably feeling satis-
fied with the injuries they had done their
enemies, sailed out of the harbour in tri.
umph at sun-rise, the succeeding morn-
ing; orders were immediately thereupon
issued for the prisoners (who had been
employed in defence of the city) to as-
semble and assist in removing the rub.

scene presented to view ! the streets
strewed with the dead and dying ! On
whatever side I turned my eyes, my atten.
tion was attracted by mangled bodies and
detached limbs, bleeding afresh. Among
a number of captives employed in bury-
ing the dead, I thought I recognized my
unfortunate husband, but dare not ap-
proach him, as my master kept a watchful
eye on me.
The business allotted the female cap-
tives, was to strip the dead, after which
they were thrown into waggons and drawn
off by the male captives, to what place I
could never learn. The wounded were
carried on the shoulders of captives to the
hospitals, where they were visited by the
Cadi, and presented with, six dollars
each.
After the bustle and confusion had a
little subsided, we were again ordered to
our place of confinement and labour,
from whence we had been taken, we had
not, however, been long here before we
were again aroused by the discharge of
cannon, and beating of the raritoo, a cus-
tomary signal for the slaves to assemble.

It was at this moment that I could plainly
perceive a sudden change of countenance
in
my fellow captives, those in an especial
manner who had been long in captivity.
Our governess hurried us off as quick as
possible to the castle, at the door of which
were assembled (as I judged) nearly 1000
people, and the captives were then con-
tinually flocking in. About 3 P. M. or.
ders were given by the grand Vizier (my
master) for the forming a procession, and
it was at this moment that I learned the
cause of our assembling : it appeared that
during the late action, a captive belonging
to the Cadi had made an attempt to
escape, by swimming to one of the ene.
my's boats, but was observed, pursued
and retaken. The affair so exasperated
the Cadi, that he gave orders for his im.
mediate execution. For the information
of the reader, it may be well to mention,
that on all such occasions, it is ever cus-
tomary for the captives to attend, gene-
rally, that they may be eye witnesses to
those scenes of savage torture, inflicted
by the barbarians on such as attempt an
escape, in order to deter them from mak-

About 4 P. M. a procession was form-

victim into as small pieces as one's little
finger.
The grand Vizier dismounted and
ascended a lofty stage, a station always
prepared for him on such occasions, and
from which he gave orders for his execu.

to bring forward the unhappy victim, at
the same time commanding silence. The
poor fellow was instantly dismounted and
led up to the accursed machine ; he was

was drawn to the fatal shears, which at

the pleasing anticipation of once more

After a close confinement of nearly
three
years, I was one evening visited by
my master, who was accompanied by my
friend Malcome; the latter had been
nearly eight years in captivity, and had
learned to speak the language of the coun:
try extremely well, and many times

my friend, - he could converse with me
in presence of his master upon any sub.

stood not a word of English. He inform-

means to gratify a lustful passion, he had
commanded him to solicit my compli.
ance, and to inform me, that if I would
willingly consent to indulge him in what
he should request, he would extend to me
the same liberty which his wives (or con-
cubines) enjoyed :--but, continued my
friend Malcome, fear not, do not be ter-
rified at his threats; he will do doubt do
every thing in his power to compel you
to comply with his request, but should'
he attempt any such thing against your
will, he will lose his head.
versation was held in the presence of my
ruffian master, to whom my friend was
to interpret my answer, which he inform-
ed me he did in the following words-viz.
That I would never consent to gratify him
in his unlawful request, as it would be in
direct violation of the laws of my God
and my country.

this unexpected reply, desired Malcome
to inform me that he would give me a day
to consider on it, but if I should then re-
fuse, he would adopt such a plan as should
soon make me repent of my folly-say,
ing this, he left me ; but my mind was en-
dued with that fortitude, that I resolved
sooner to die, than to submit to his bru.
tal proposals.
Early the succeeding morning I was
again called upon by my master, accom.
panied by my friend Malcome, through
whom inquiry was made whether I had
concluded to comply with his proposal ;
my answer, as interpreted by my friend
was, “No! I will sooner suffer death!”
This was an answer as displeasing as it
was unexpected to the tyrant-he be..
came now like a mad-man, drawing his
dirk he threatened me with instant death,
unless I would immediately comply with
his request ; but finding that I still per:
sisted in my determination, he left me,
swearing that my obstinacy should yet
cost me my life! All this was inter-
preted to me by my friend, who, as he

retired, told me that he would do all in
his power to protect me from the vio.
lence of the wretch.
The plan next pursued by my master
to accomplish his wishes, was, to repre.
sent me to his friend, the bey, as a per.
son sent into the country to conspire
against the government! This plan, in
part, had its desired effect, for no sooner
was the bey informed of this, than he or-
dered me to be conveyed immediately to
Sersel (situated within a few miles of the
city of Algiers) there to be confined in
irons, in an apartment of an old castle.
The room in which I was confined was
built of rough stone, and the walls were
about eight feet in depth; it contained but
one small window, with large iron grat-
ings, and which afforded so little light
that I could hardly discern an objcct six
feet from me. My furniture consisted of
a three legged stool, and a gallon stone
jug, which was occasionally filled with
stinking water.
On the second day of my confinement,
a smith entered my apartment with a
hammer and chains in abundance, which,

wall. This ring was five feet from the
ground, and only allowed me to sit down

a consoling friend, and who under all
these afflictions, trusted for her recovery
to the efforts of nature alone !
Sickness itself is sufficient to humble
the mightiest mind ; what then is sickness
with such an addition of torment! The
burning fever, the violent head-achs, my
neck, swelled and inflamed with the irons,
enraged me almost to madness. The
fever and the fetters together, flead my

burning entrails with cold water, the jug
broke! I had four-and-twenty hours to
remain without water.
On my attendants visiting me the next
day, they supposed the dead, as I lay mo.
tionless with my tongue out of my mouth.
They poured water down my throat, and
found life.


## p. 101 (#107) ############################################

101
Gracious Being ! how pure, how deli.
cious, how exquisite, was this water!
My insatiable thirst soon emptied the jug,
they filled it anew, bade me farewell,
hoped death would soon relieve my mor-
tal sufferings, and departed.
Three days had passed before I could
again eat a morsel of bread. The irons
every where round my body, and their
weight was insupportable ; nor could I
imagine it was possible I should habituate
myself to them, or endure them long
enough to expect deliverance. A thou-
sand reasons convinced me it was neces-
sary to end my sufferings. I shall not
enter into theological disputes : let those
who blame me imagine themselves in my
situation ; or rather first let them actu-
ally endure my miseries, and then let
them reason.
What strange thing is that called hap-
piness ? How shall I express my extreme
joy, when after eleven months intolerable
hunger, I was indulged with a sweet loaf
of bread free from mould? The fond
lover never rushed more eagerly to the
arms of his bride ; the famished tiger

you cannot procure; remember how sim.

should indeed have been driven to des.

relief. When my attendants opened my
dungeon, they found me in a truly pitiful
situation, wondered
at my appetite,
brought me another loaf; I refused to ac.
cept it, believing I should never more
have occasion for bread; they however
left it with me, gave me water, shrugged
up their shoulders, and left me.

Early one morning I heard the door's
of my dungeon unbarring the doors of
my dungeon for the last time resounded !
--a gentleman clad in Christian habit
accompanied by the keeper, entered-joy
beamed upon his countenance-it was
the English Consul.
"I have come,
madam,(said he) to liberate you from un.
just and cruel bondage !" Oh! what
joy did I feel on the occasion ; it was a
long time before I could be convinced of
the truth of what he told me, nor could I
believe it until a smith was sent for to
knock off my irons. .
I was now re-conducted out of the
dark and dismal dungeon, in which I had
been closely confined for three years. It
appeared that my friend Malcome, in the
absence of his master, had been favoured
with an opportunity to escape, which he
improved and arrived in safety at Algiers,
here he found the English consul, and to
him related the particulars of his captivi-
ty, and informed him of my wretched si.
tuation, and the principal cause of my un-
just imprisonment. The consul, accom-
panied by the informant waited upon the

bey, and made a demand of me as one of
his Britannic majesty's subjects, unjust-
ly and unlawfully held in captivity. The
bey at first discredited the story of Mal.
come, and seemed confirmed in the be-
lief that I had been sent into the coun-
try for some treasonable purpose, but on
being assured by the consul that he would
leave the country within twenty-four hours
if I was not immediately released, the bey
consented to deliver me up.
The consul conducted himself with a
great deal of humanity towards me, he
procured for me a suit of clothes of which
I was very much in want, and promised
to procure me a passage to England as
soon as possible. I acquainted him with
the misfortunes of my husband and those
who were saved from the ship, but was
unable to inform him what had become of
them since I parted with them at the mar.
ket house; he informed me that he would
do all in his power to learn their fate, and
if still living, he would procure their re-
lease immediately, but, added he, as it is
not at the present moment convenient for
me to go in search of them, and your

health being much impaired by long con-
finement, you had, I think, better em-
brace the first. opportunity to return to
your friends. I thanked him for his
friendly advice as well as for the many
services he had rendered me, and told
him that I would do whatever he should
think for the best. Accordingly, on the
sixth day after my liberation, I once more
embarked to visit my native country, with
à view of which, after a tedious passage
of 45 days, my eyes were once more re.
galed.
As soon as I landed, a carriage was
procured for me, at the expense of the
captain, to convey me to the dwelling of
iny parents. About sun-set I arrived,
my aged father met me at the door; my
sudden and unexpected arrival was too
much for him, he fainted! Here it may
be necessary to inform the reader, that as
my friends had never received any news
of the vessel or crew, they had concluded
that we had all long since been buried in
the deep.
Although providentially restored to my
friends, misfortune and disappointment

seemed yet to mark me as their own! I
had been flattering myself with the fond
hope that on my arrival, I should be so
fortunate as to meet with my husband,
whom I fattered myself might have pos-
sibly escaped, but no news of him had
been received since his departure. But,
with what pleasure do I close this melan-
choly relation of my sufferings, by adding
that six months after my arrival, my
husband arrived, and apparently in a
good state of health, having obtained his
liberty through the influence of the Bri-
tish consul.

A True Account of my being taken, and
Sufferings during my Captivity.
Pon the 27th day of August 1684. I Thomas
Phelps set sail from the Downs in a Vessel called
the Success of London, about fourty Tuns, laden
with Salt, bound for a place in Ireland called
- the Pentrey, where we arrived the 10th, da
of September ; I stayed there some while, and kill'd Beat,
designing for the Madera's and Mount Sarrat; accordingly
on the Zoth of September, I set sail for the Madera's, but
my design was crost, and my Voyage stopt as followeth :
Upon the 5th. of Ottober (being then a Hundred Leagues,
West off the Rock of Lisbon) we saw a sail to windward of
us,which immediatly we found to give us chace;we made what
sail we could from him, and night coming on, we had, for
about Two hours, lost sight of him, but at the rising of the
Moon, he got sight of us, and quickly came up with us, hail-
ingus whence our Ship, we answered from London, deman-
ding the like of him, who made answer from Algeir, and
withal commanded us to hdist out our Boat, which we re-
fused to do, but we brac'd our head-sailes for him, immo-
diatly ine sent his Boat towards us, when it was got almost
by our side, we gave them Three shouts, which so surpriz'd
them, that they thought it convenient to retire aboard their

own Ship; We were not a little chear'd at their departure
and made from them with all the sail we could make, for we
had not one great Gun, and as for Powder, I believe one sin-
gle pound was the outmost of our store: Pathe mean time he
was hoisting in of his Boat, I had got above two miles from
him, which made me think I was clear of him, and withal
that the Ship must be an Algerine, she appearing so great, that,
according to the stories in Englund, I thought no such Ship
could belong to Sallé; But i found my self within a little
while, mightily mislaken, for as soon as his Boat was hoi-
sted in, he presently fetch'd us up again: We had try’d his
sailing all ways, but found we could not wrong him any way ;
so seeing him a stern, and a thing impossible to lose sight of
tis, I put out à light for him, notwithstanding I was possest
it that time (God knows) with fear enough, but Ithought,
: Dark, my seeming confidence and resolution might
impose upon him, so as to fancy I was of some force : Ānd
truly afterwards he confessed to me, that he thought I had six
Gufis aboard and that I did intend to fight him.
He kept a stern of me all night, and in the morning he put
out Turkish colours, which sanswered with our English ;
then he came up, and saw Łhad no boat in fight, for my
boat was stow'H'down betwixt decks, he commanded me
therefore to brace to my head-sailes, and then he sent his
boat to demand my pass; Aboard her was an antient Moor,
who formerly had been a slave in England and spoke good
English, and who was set at liberty by our late Gracious King
£harles the od. He seeing us in readiness with what arms.
we had, ask'd me, if I had a mind to break the Peace, he
told me I needed not trouble my self to keep them out of our
Wessel, for none of them could be perswaded to come aboard
I brought him my Custom-house-Cocketts, for I had no
Pass : The Moor aforesaid carried them to the crio.

n after returned, and told me that would not satisfit the
Captain, unless the Master himself would come : i made 40-
swer that I would not come, that I had done what I was 3-
blig'd to by the Articles 'twixt Bngland and Algiers: The
boat a second time put away for their Ship, and whilst .
they were hoisting in their boat, I made what sail I could,
. was got a mile or more from them again, entertaining
better hopes than 1 was in the night before ; But as soon as
the boat was in and stow'd, the Moors made sail and came up
with me again, the Captain ordering to tell me, that if l re-
fus’d to come a board him, he would come aboard me with
his Ship; with that he rang'd up my Weather quarter, I im-
o; put a stays, which put him into some confusion,
fothat he was forced to put a stays also : He had then no Gun,
which I could perceive, I saw his Ports, and his Wast was
Man-high . As I came about I run under his stern, then bore
away right before the Wind, he soon came up with me, but
not one shot pas'd all this while, he demanded of me why I
clapt a stays for to run a thwart his halse; I answered that I
doubted he was not of Algier, he swore in English, to me
that he was, else before this he would have discover'd him-
self, and withal he told me, that if I did not come aboard,
he would straightway sink me, and so he hoisted out his boat,
in the mean time I boar away, but his boat coming up ma
me bring to again and brace a back; His boat then came a-
board, I ask'd this Moor, who spoke English, what ship of
Algiers this was , he very readily without stammering
told me, she was call'd the Tagerene young Canary Com-
mander, I immediatly then went into his boat; so soon as I
came aboard, the Captain ask'd me why I was so hard of be-
lief, My distrust was such then that I pray'd the Captain now
that he had me aboard in his power, to resolve me whether
he were a Sallé-man or not, he swore to me again that he
was of Algiers, and that I loo, be wrong'd : He made

attempt to come near, but endeavour as much as they can,
‘me sit down, and caus’d them to set Dates and Figgs before me:
A little after the Captain told me that he was made acquainted
by his men that they saw two Portugueses aboard my Ship,
and that he would have them out, and then I should be gone
about my business, I told him I had none such aboard, but he
would sce them two men, so two men were sent for, after
that he told me there were three more and them he must
have, well to be short, at last he wassuspicious that I was a
Portuguese also, and to convince me that I was one,I found my
entertainment presently withdrawn? Thus did this faithless
Barbarian serve me, until he had wheadled all my men aboard
him except two, and then the valiant Moors entred my Wes.
fel with abundance of courage, heaving the two remaining
English over the head of the Vessel into the boat.
Thus were we all Strip'd, the Vessel Plunder'd in a mo-
ment, which they did resolve to have sunk, because they
were too farr at Sea distant from their own coast, but Imme-
diatly we saw five sail bearing down upon us, which startled
the Moors, putting them into a great fright, obliging them
to quit my Vessel with abundance of Beaf and three Boxes
of dry goods aboard, which their fear would not §
leasure to rummage for : In some small time the five Vessels
discover'd us, when they came within two Leagues of us,
had they bore down afterwards with that resolution, that
they threatned before, the Pirate would never have stood to
look them in the face; but alass like distraćted fearful game,
every of the five Ships took a several course, and being now
night they all escaped. - -
After that we cruised about thirty Leagues to the West of
the Northern Cape, and so to the Burlings, but no nearer than
Twenty Leagues to the shoar, and therefore I imagin there
is more safety for small vessels bound that way, to keep the
shore as near as is possible, for I know certainly they never

to avoid the shoar because our Men of War use to careen at
Lisbon. - - - -
i am likewise pretty well satisfied for that small time that I
was amongst them, altho' it was too long for my profit) that:
no sa/grin will fight a Ship of Ten Guns, which I found
true by observation of a County-man from Bristol, whilst I
was aboard : We came up with him and hail'd him, and
would have had him put out his Boat, but he refused, and
withal shew’d himself ready in his own defence, upon which
we were glad to leave him. -
So that to satisfie all my Country-men who follow my
trade I dare confidently affirm, that if I had a Ship of Ten
Guns, and it should be my fortune to encounter any of these
Sa/e-rogues, ( who all go under the notion of Algerines,
who are now at peace with England, I would encourage him
to send his boat, by acquainting him that our Master would
come aboard and shew his pass, (which is the thing they aim
at) And when the boat was come to my side, (any man of
reason may judge then whether she were from Sa/é or Al-
giers, but however I would commit nothing should be judg-
ed a breach of the Peace, 'twixt Fngland and Algiers ) I
would heave in a Grapling and secure the men, all save two,
whom I would permitt to return aboard and bring me a Chri-
stian, or else aver my Pass, if they will not do that, I am
then satisfied what he is, and think my self obliged to de-
fend my self from Slavery, but this I am very confident of,
that he will never stay to dispute the case afterward.
. . About a fortnight after I was taken, we met one Samael
Crampton who came from Faro, and whom we soon took
without any resistance. The week following we took a smalf
Ketch come from Cales, laden with Sherry and Raisins and
bound for Limrick, john Elliot Master. - -

the Pirate, in all Thirty seven; We who were newly taken
were kept in Irons in the Hold. --. . .
After the taking of these Three Vessels the Pirate made
all the sail he could for Sallé to save the spring Tide, which
flows at Sallé and Mamora S S W about Thirty Leagues:
To the Northward of Sallé, we met a Fleming who came
from Salle, and told our Commander that the English-men
of War were at Tangier then, attending Captain Nicholason,
which caused us to bear direétly for Sallé and fell in dircétly
with the Castle, where were no English-men of War, ac-
cording to the Advice.
On the Bar of Sallé there run a great Sea, which obliged
us to come to an Anchor near the Bar,where we rid Six hours;
then were we poor Christians all let loose from our Iron-
shackles, wherein we had been confin'd for Twenty days
preceeding: the Captain sent the Boat, as near the Shore to
the South of the Bar, as possibly he could, to enquire what
News, there they were acquainted that they might, safely
come in the next high Water: whilst the Boat was gone a
Shore, the Moors, we observ'd, fell all fast a sleep, the Cap-
tain also, with his Head over the Rail, upon the half-Deck
seem'd deeply ingag’d: This opportunity me thought was
very inviting, I made a proposal of it to my fellow Slaves,
and undertook to do the Captains business my sclf: The
Christians were forward enough to comply with the motion,
and Eleven of the Twelve, (which were Slaves retain’d in
the Ship before our being taken they also were willing,if the
Twelfth who was Steward in the Ship would have consented,
but this sneaking varlet prov’d recreant, and for fear of him.
the other Eleven turn’d also Renegadoes to this Heroick and
Christian resolution; I had a mind to have dispatcht this
troubler of our peace out of the way first, but the fear that
his fellow Slaves would have severely resented it, restrain'd.

civility from the Moors than him. - - . .
At four in the Afternoon, we weighed Anchor,and stood in
for the Bar, we struck Twicegoing over, but without any dam:
mage; it was upon the First day of November, after we had
helped to moor our Ship, at Night we were all carried ashore,
and conveyed to our Lodging, which was an old Stable, but
without Litter or Straw, having nothing save the bare dirty
Ground for our Bed or Pillow; the next Day we were alk
carryed aboard the Ship to Unrigg her, and get out her Bal-
last, which we did; abott Four in the Afternoon, I was sent for
ashore to come to the Governour, who passed his sentence on
us Three Masters, that we should go to his House, and there
remain,until wewere sent for by the King; we remained at his
HouseTen days,where our daily employment was to Grind the
Corn for the use of his Family; at length there came an Order
for us, and all the rest of the Christians to be carryed to the
King, whose Ordinary and then Residence was at Machaness,a
place which this present Emperour has set his Fancy upon, and
bestows most of his care, and employs all Christian Slaves in
Building there; it is distant from Sassé about Seventy Miles,
and from Fez Thirty. "
In our Journy thither, I cannot forget our Captains extra-
ordinary civility, in Accommodatingus sometimes with Bor-
ricoes to ride on, so that in Two days and a half we arrived:
thither: The First night we were not brought before our great
Master, but the following our Captain presented us before
him, and withal some Portuguese Plate, which was taken,
in Mr.Crampton's Vessel; as the Captain gave it into his Hand,
the surly Tyrant with a seeming scorn and disdain heav'd it
against the Wall, which was the first Aétion I observ'd, and
did a little discover the temper of my new Patron Muley Iso-
mael Emperour of Morocco and Fez, &c. He ordered us to
be sent amongst the rest of our fellow Slaves; as we went we

were entertain'd with the civilities of the place, and wel-
comed by the joyfull acclamations and complements of the
Moors kicking and slapping us all along, which appeared
very uncouth to me, who was but a Stranger, but that Night
my fellow Captives allayed my wonder, by acquainting me,
that what had past was nothing, it was only a sutable Pro-
logue to all the Tragical sufferings that Christians must en-
dure there whilst they are Slaves, which were so dreadful, that
. I could willingly, that very Night have ventured my Life
to endeavour an escape; they Painted out to me the Tyran-
nical humour of the Emperour, both towards the Christians
and Natives, in such Bloudy Colours, viz, how they had seen
him Butcher many Thousands with his own hands, how that
none can be secure in his presence for that the varying of a
look, a small spot in the Garment, or any such inconsiderable
circumstance, will raise such a caprice in the Emperours Nod-
dle, without any other provocation, as to endanger all the
Heads before him, and it is very rare if the company escape
with One or Two only Beheaded, or Lanced through the
Bodv. -
#. Second day after my arrival thither, I saw him Lance
Seven and twenty Negroes one after another, and every Day
after, until New-years-day, (when he parted to Santa Cruz
with his Army I either saw or heard of his inhumane,but yet,
through custom, to him Natural Barbarities, Killing and
Dragging, but this latter is a picce of respect observed only
to Minions and Favourites, Vice-kings and Alcaids; yea his
Women are not able by all their Charms to avoid his Fury,
but are more the objećts of his implacable rage than any other
passion: I have been several times in the West-Indies, and
have seen and heard of divers Inhumanities and cruelties pra-.
étised there, I have also read in Books, and have heard Lear-
ned men discourse of the Sicilian Tyrants and Roman Em-
perours, but indeed I forget them all, they are not to o

named in comparison with this Monster of 4friek, a com:
position of Gore and Dust, whom nothing can attone But
humane Sacrifices, and to be in whose court it is much more
eligible to be his Horse or his Mule, than to be his Privado
or wife of his bosome, from whose greatest kindness my
good God ever defend me,for his mercies are cruel: Yeaeyen
Hamed Ben Haddu who was his Embassadour here in England
Three years ago, altho' he was received and entertain'd here
with extraordinary civilities, and carress'd every where by all
the endearments of kindness and respect, and altho' by his
fineness and Moorish subtilty, he stole into the Inclinations
of the well-meaning and good natur'd English, so that he
obtain'd the reputation of Ingenuity and candour, Yet the
Dog has return'd to his Vomit, and by woful experiment, all
my Country-men, who come under his power, find him a
harsh and cruel Master, who manag’d his affairs here with
deep dissimulation, and now improves his knowledge of Eng-
lish affairs, to the detriment and ruin of all the Kings Sub-
jećts, with whom he has to do; if it be his fortune to meet
or pass by any of them, his custom is (as all the English can
attest) to salute them with a devilish Curse to the best of
my remembrance exprest thus, Asli Haztebuck, i.e. God
roast your Father: he is indeed reckoned a great Master in
the art of Diffimulation and Flattery, a †. which
seems very requisite in a Courtier of such a Barbarous Bloody
Tyrant as his Master is. -
But to proceed, my fellow Christians in the next place,
shewed me the staff of their life there, i.e. their Bread,
which was of Barley,but black, and withalit stunk, the Corn
being kept Seven years under Ground before us'd, one Days
allowance if sold, would yield only Nine Fluces, which 4-
mount to Three Farthings; Flesh is cheap, both Mutton and
Beef, but Mony is scarce, Two pounds and a half of Beef,

dissatisfied and very weary of my condition, and therefore I
did often rummage all my thoughts, for some expedient to
ease me of this accursed way, not of Living, but Starving
and Dying daily: My mind did often flatter me with the
greatest possibility of Liberty by running away, and so coff.
fident I was, that I discovered my intentions to several
Christians, especially to those of my near acquaintance, who
by no means could be induc’d to hear the difficulties and
dangers that attended such a resolution: In the mean time
my Friends in England had taken some care for my Ran-
some, and had given order to Mr Luddington, an English
Merchant in Bárbary, to endeavour my relief if One hun-
dred and fifty Pounds would effe&b it, which Sum Mr. Lud.

the poor Spirited Christians, and banished all such resoluti-
ons quite out of their minds: At length I opened my mind
to Mr. Baxter (who about a Year and a half before, had
made an unlucky attempt to run away, but being brought
back he had the Bastinado in such a sort that he could not
work sor a Twelve Month, having Irons continually upon
his Leśgs) but notwithstanding, such was his love of Chri-
stian Liberty, that he freely told me, that he would adven-
ture with any fair opportunity; after I had him thus engag'd
by his promise, I gave him no rest, until we had pitch'd upon
a Day; we also took into our Cabal and share of our For-
tunes, Two Bristol-men, who were ready at an hours war-
ning, when we appointed.
There are at Machanes; at present about Eight hundred
Christians of all Nations, Two hundred and sixty whereof
are English, several of which have tendred Mony for their
Ransom, some Seven hundred, some Five hundred pieces of
Eight, some more, some less, but the King still put them off
with this, that he would clear none particularly, but that
they should go all together. -
january the First, The King set forward towards Santa
Cruz,with an Army of about Sixty thousand men, designing to
quel his Nephew, who had made a formidable Insurrečtion
against him, in that part of his Dominions: We Christians
could not Inform our selves of the certain proceedings of these
Armies, neither did we much care, fight Dog, fight Bear,
but this we learnt, that it will be Two or Three years before
his return, and it is not to be suppos'd that any particular
Christian will be releas'd until he return; besides, there is
no hopes to be laid upon the most solemn word and protesta-
tion of this swarthy Infidel Muley Ismael, for, as I have
becm inform’d, about Four or Five years ago, by an agree-
ment with Collonel Kirk, all the English slaves were to be
set at liberty at the rate of Two hundred piec, of Fo

head, and the bargain was so far struck, that the Christians
were got a Mile out of Town, But the accursed Jews, (the
stench and pest of the Nations of the Earth, Malicious to
all Man-kind and loathsome and abominable whereever they
come, who not only have the blood of the Saviour of the
World lying upon their heads, but are acceuntable for the
blood of many Thousands of his Members which they daily
shed). These wicked Enemies of Christianity, brought back
these poor Christians into the house of bondage thus, they
proffered the Emperour as much mony as the King of Eng-
land rendred for the Christians Ransome, if so be he would
only lend them for a while, to build a City for the Jews, and
then they should be restor'd to the King? The covetous Ty-
rant soon clos'd with these advantageous terms, and the Chri-
ans were turn'd over to the Jews, who imploy'd them Three
years in building a City, but when finish'd, see the just Judg-
ment of God!The Jews were turn'd out,and forc'd to give place
to the Moors: Another remarkable story concerning the Jews
I cannot but insert upon this occasion : About Three years
ago, Mr. Bowrey of Bristol was, with Twenty sail more,
taken by the Sallé-men, Bowrey had a parcel of Soap in his
Ship, which then did belong to the King; Ben Haddu Am-
bassadour in England desir'd to buy this Soap of the King,
but a Jew out bid him, and so had the Soap, for which dea.
ling the Ambassador kept a grudge in his mind against the
Jews, and was reveng'd on them, after this manner, whilst
I was there. He inform'd the King that the Jews had im-
pos'd upon him and couzen'd him of Fifty thousand pieces of
Eight in the matter of the Soap, upon which the King clapt
up Ten of the chief Jews in Prison, until they should either
pay the said Sum, or else restore the Soap, which it is to be
supposed, hath been sold in Christendom Two years ago.

A'. a serious *onsideration, finding that no proffers
... for my redemption would be accepted, I committed
the conduct of my proceedings to Almighty providence
resolving to make an Escape in company of Three more,
Edmund Baxter; Hothony Bayle, and james Ingran: , , o.

for a Blankil, Öse), 24 ob. a piece, we had the liberty to be
exeus’d from work that day, we went there fore to the Town
of Machaness, and having but a small stock of cash about us,
víg. nine Blankils, we laid it out in Bread, and two small
#acks' bladders, with a little Burdock to carry Water

About Three of the clock in the Afternoon we began our
journey designing to go as far as an Old house, cai'd the
Kings: Hodso distaatsabout Three miles: from Machawess ;
#esosving to contëal out solves about that house until night,
affda romising to our selves the greater, security; because
we kndw some Christians used commonly to work there,
but peereeding in our journey, we discover'd upon a loaded
Horse the Moor whö'fived at that house, which oblig'd us
to quicken our pace, and keep a head of him , for, if he
theuld come up with us, he would easily discover that we

before him, and coming near the house, we discover'd about
Twenty Moors sitting there; which accident of being hem-
ed in behind and before by these our cnemies, put us into
a great fright, and had in all likely hood spoil'd our design,
in the very entrance, if providence had not presented to
our view, on one side of the house, a parcel of Lime-kills, to
which, without the Moors observation we immedially struck
up, where we absconded our selves by lying flat upon our
bellies; about half an hour after came two Moorish women
thither, to gather up some loose wood, we confidering it
very inconvenient to shew our selves fearful, lest 'we should
be taken for Renagadoes, spoke to them, but they return'd
us no answer, following their business, and taking us, asvvc
judged, either for Moors or Christians employ'd about the

broke clear, we saw abundance of Cattle grasing in the
bottom, with Moors,who lookt after them,but, by Gods pro-
vidence, none came near us, so that we lay safe all that day,
being the last day of May.
At night we set forwards, keeping the Woods, where .
were no Moorish Inhabitants, only wild beasts, the less sa-
vage and formidable, which we often saw, but they never
attempted to come near us, we travel'd about Ten miles
that night, and then crossed a River, which supplied us with
Water, whereof we were in want; on the other side of the
River, we observ'd the footsteps of a great many Cattle,
which rendred the place, as we ...; unsafe for us, we
made therefore a little further progress in the morning, to
the top of the Hill, where under a large Oak we found a bush
convenient for our reception that day, but within a little
while we were disturb in our repose, observiñg the Cattle to
come grasing up the Hill, directly to that bush, with Moors
at their heels, with all hast therefore we pact up our luggage
and ran a mile further, without being discover'd, until we
came to a Pear tree, furnish'd with long-grass a round him,
there we took up our quarters all that day, being the First
of June.
The night following, we intended to proceed, but it plea-
sed God, to strike melame with the Gout, so that I was not
able to stand, I was forced therefore to remain there all that
night, and the day .# which was a great hindrance
to my companions, and afflićtion to my self: The readiest
expedient to remedy my distemper, which I could think upon
was this, we made a fire in a hole in the ground, and I put
my Foot into the hole to draw away the pain, having also a
Lancet with us, I endeavour'd to breath a Wein in my Foot,
but I could not effect it, for the Lancet would not enter,
however, I found some ease by the force of the fire: My
company being sensible of the delay, which my distemper
occasion'd,

occasion'd, began to be mov’d, insomuch that they told me,
that if I could not march with them that night, they must
hold themselves oblig'd to take leave of me, which added
a great afflićtion to my sorrow, insomuch as I was the Au-
thor and first mover of this escape; That I might not there-
fore be forsaken by my companions, and in compliance to
their importunity, I resolved to strain my outmost power.
The third of june at night I endeavoured to go, but in
great pain, so that we could not proceed above Three miles,
when I was forc'd to pray my Companions to stay but that
night, and I did not question, but by Gods blessing, to be
able to travel with them the next, they consented, and so
we took up our lodging for the remainder of that night,
under another Pear-tree. . . " . .
... The fourth of jane I kept baking my foot all the day in
the Ground, till about two in the Afternoon, in the mean
while, I procur'd Mr. Baxter to make me a wooden Leg,
which accordingly he did, I perswaded them, then, to tra-
vel about . Three or Four miles that afternoon, which would
a little ease the labour of the night, they agreed, I travel'd
about Four miles with that Leg, and then rested till night on
the top of a high Hill, whence we saw a great plain valley
before us.
At night we shap'd our course clear of the Tents, and tra-
vel'd over the edge of the plain, about Six miles; We past
by several fields of corn, the Moors in the mean time hallow-
ing to frighten the wild beasts from them: Crossing of a Ri-
vor that night, we saw and heard several Lyons, some ap-
‘proach'd so near that we could almost have touch'd them,but
as soon as we strook fire, which we had prepar'd for that very
purpose, they presently vanish'd; when the light began to
display itself, we took our quarters for the next day, which
was june the Fifth ; At night we continued our course,
when H was still lame, which was a great hindrance to my

most at an end, the consideration whereof oblig'd me to strain

3ame the Sixth, We set onward, and measur'd Ten miles
that night, when we came to a great Swamp, there my
pain renewing, I fain would have perswaded them to stay
but by no intreaties could perswade them, so resolving to
part, we shar'd our Bread, which came to two half Rusksa
peice; I endeavour'd to allure my weak wearied Brother to
abide with me, comforting him with the expectation of Gar-
dens, where we two more easily than the company of Four,
might provide for our selves; He would not stay; Being

became perfectly whole and clear of the Gout;. That night
we travel'd over a high barren Hill, where we fancied we
heard the Suss and noise of the Sea, which encourag'd us to
mend our pace until we met with a Garden, where we ga-
ther'd about a dozen of small Pumpkins, a very comforta-
ble assistance to us, now that our Bread was all spent, for
some we eat raw, and some we roasted in the ground, where-
by we found our selves considerably refresht; That night we
made no more then Eight miles, for meeting with a great
Oak which was blown down, we thought it inconvenient to
overslip such an advantageous retirement for the next day,
which we were the more desirous off, because we heard a
great many Moors, tho' we could not see them,

ment we heard the noise of the Sea, at night we put on and

Course then Northward for Two miles, when we could di-
scern the Castle, but knowing that we could not go to the
northward of the Castle, because the great River goes di-
rectly up into the Country, we turn'd back about a mile, and
finding a convenient bush, we rested there all the next day,
hearing and seeing a great many Cattle, but none came near
US.
fune the Eighth, we gathered about half a Peck of Snailes,
and caught a Land-Tortois, which we roasted and eat har-
tily, that day also, we saw a Ship in the Offing, when night
was come, we made down towards the Castle, and before
we were aware we fell upon a Moor making a fire, which
forc'd us to draw back, the Moor not discerning us, we fetcht
then a compass, and by another way came down to the
Castle, there we found a strong watch, which did wholly
discourage our expe&tations of relief from that place, so we
set up our Resolutions for Salé, about Eighteen or Twenty
miles to the Southward, to see what good could be done
there, But before we parted with Mamora, we made bold
with a little Barley and Guinny corn, growing under the
Castle, of each whereof we gathered about a quarter of a
Peck, to serve our necessities, and then we betook our selves to
our former nights refuge, the Bush, and after having consulted
how to steer our course for Salé, the result whereof was a
long the Sea-side, we rested all the next day without distur-
bance. -
june the Ninth, We travel'd along the Sea-side, where we
saw a great deal of Raft-timber, we concluded therefore,
seeing the Ship in the Offing, to make a Raft, which accor-
dingly we did, and put off with it, but it would not swim,
boyart with us all, we came therefore a shore, and cut all
our Lashings, leaving it to the mercy of the Sea : We tra-
yel'd Five miles towards Sallé that night, fearing least by
staying long thereabout we should be ğ. for our foot-

might secure us from discovery ; we pitch'd upon a Bush in
a great Valley , , wherein we resolv'd to enclose our.

The eleventh day being past, at night we made a descent
to the River of Sallé, about a mile above the Town, where
we founda Boat, but could not with all our strength launch
her: Anthony Bayle and I who were the only swimmers in
our company, made over to the South-fide of the River, to
see what purchase we could make there, we found indeed
Three boats, but they were all aground, so that we could
do no good with them ; But in searching about the new
Ships, which Five in number are building there) we found
two Qares, with which we swam over to our consorts, and
all.

all together we went down by the Rivers side, to the
bours mouth, but we could meet with no boat to put our
Oares in ; We saw two Dutch-men in the River, but they
kept a diligent watch, which hindred us from carrying away
their boat ; We concluded therefore to bury our Garts in
the sand at some remarkable place, and so we betook our
selves to find out a sanétuary for the day following; We found
a Fig-tree full of leaves, in an unlrequented place, as we
thought, on the North-side of the River, yet within call of
the Ships, vvhich then vwere a building 2 Under the Covert

The Reader may possibiy judge this an instance of a Roman-

dent consideration; Truly, he is in the right, for yve our
selves vvere of the same mind, about the middle of the next

stood off, and at length saw us, we pull'd aboard, and found
her to be the Lark-Friggot Captain Leighton Commander;
after some Examination and Discourse about the Methods
and Means of our Escape, I propounded to the Captain a de-
sign which had newly taken strong possession of my Fancy, it
was this, that if he would accommodate me with his Boat,
and those belonging to the other Two Men of War, which
were in Company, I would undertake to Pilot them in, and
to buro what Ships were then at Mamora; The Captain im-
mediately stood to the Northward, and came up with the
other Two Ships, which were the Bonaventure and the Gray-
hound; The Admiral was then Sick at Cales, so Captain
Macdonald being Eldest Captain, we went aboard him, and

Captain Prieftman, who was Sick as abovesaid, they held a
Council about those propositions which I had made; at first
they seemed unpraćticable, by reason of many difficulties,
but especially of the Bar, which is worse than that of Saúč;
but then when upon Second thoughts they considered the
forwardness of Men, who but that very Day had escapt a
heavy Slavery, and yet were willing that very Night to en-
gage in the action, they concluded it both possible and fea-
#. so they entertain'd with approbation what I had pro-
pos'd ; After which I immediately return'd with Captain
Ileighton aboard the Lark, and communicated the result of
the Council with my Comrade Mr. Baxter, who was heartily
pleas'd with what was undertaken, and willing to go along,
so he was ordered to go in the Bonaventure's Boat, and was
very serviceable, and who was better acquainted with that
Bar, than I was. Immediately orders were given to shave
some Deal-boards, and saw some Tarr-barrels, and make rea-
dy with all expedition; by Seven at Night, all things were
in readiness, the Friggots were riding Two Leagues from
Shore, orders were given that the Boat in which I was, viz.
the Gray-hound's, should go a head, Commanded by Captain
Macdonald, who behaved himself indeed with great Courage
and Resolution, and the rest had orders to follow us; there
were Three Barges in all, and one Yawl, the number of Men
concern'd in the adion, was Forty two, who all had strićt
charge upon pain of Death, not to seek after Plunder, which
was punétually observ'd. About Eight at Night we put off
from the Ships, and betwixt Nine and Ten, we fell a little
to the Northward of the Bar, but by Mr. Baxter's assistance,
we quickly righted our selves, and found the Bar; there
was a great noise upon the Shore, all thereabout had taken
the Alarm, which did nothing discourage us, we proceeded
lustily, without any concernment at their hideous outcries,

undaunted Resolutions, they thought it best to slie betimes
and secure themselves and their Castle; in the mean time we
utsu'd our design towards the Ships, aboard which, there
being a great many Lights, we observ'd the Moors looking
over the sides of the first we came to, which was the bigger
of the Two, they call'd to us, to keep off, we answered
them with about Twenty Granado-shells, which soon drove
them overboard; they had not far indeed to escape, for the
Castle Wall was within a Boats length of the Ship, so with-
out any difficulty we presently entred; one Moor we found
aboard, who was presently cut in pieces, another was shot
in the head, endeavouring to escape upon the Cable, we
were not long in taking in our Shavings and, Tarr-barrels,
and so set her on fire in several places, she being very apt to re-
ceive what we design'd, for there were several Barrels of
Tat upon the Deck, and she was newly Tarr'd as if on pur-
rose; whilst we were setting her on fire, we heard a noise of
ome people in the Hold, we opened the Skuttles, and thereby
fav'd the fives of Four Christians, Three Dutch-men and One
French, who told us that the Ship on fire was Admiral and
belong'd to Aly-Hackum, and the other which we soon after
ferv'd with the same sauce, had the Name of Plummage
cartile, which was the very Ship, which in October last
took me Captive, I cannot deny that I was possessed with an
extraordinary satisfaction to see this Ship on fire, and I
could not but admire the wonderful providence of God, to
whom alone Vengeance belongeth, in vindicating my cause,
and making me an unwitting instrument of revenge, for the
injuries I received from the owners of this Vessel. -

they quite negleåed their Cares, so that if the Tide had
not turt.” to Ebb, we should have run a great risque, our
Men were so full of joy, hooping and hallowing at the
sight of so desirable a Bon-fire, that they never minded
the dangers they might be subject to ; we were therefore
forced to tow the Bonaventure's Yawl, who had lost all her
Oares. In all this A&tion we had but one Man mortally
wounded, and two or three more slightly. hurt; after we
had compleated our business, and absolutely destroyed these
Ships, we return'd' out of the River, over the Bar, and

so, and gratified us with the entertainment of his Ship

at Cales, before we met with an opportunity for England

PREFACE. 
 
 ONE of the first observations the author of the 
 following sheets made upon his return to his na 
 tive country, after an absence of seven years, was 
 the extreme avidity with which books of mere 
 amusement were purchased and perused by all 
 ranks g& his countrymen. When he left New Eng 
 land, books of biography, travels, novels, and mod 
 ern romances, were confined to our seaports ; or, 
 if known in the country, were read only in the 
 families of clergymen, physicians, and lawyers : 
 while certain funeral discourses, the last words and 
 dying speeches of Bryan Shaheen, and Levi Ames, 
 and some dreary somebody s Day of Doom, formed 
 the most diverting part of the farmer s library. On 
 his return from captivity, he found a surprising 
 alteration in the public taste. In our inland towns 
 of consequence, social libraries had been instituted, 
 composed of books designed to amuse rather than to 
 instruct; and country booksellers, fostering the new 
 born taste of the people, had filled the whole land 
 with modern travels, and novels almost as incredi 
 ble. The diffusion of a taste for any species of 
 writing through all ranks, in so short a time, would 
 appear impracticable to an European. The pea 
 sant of Europe must first be taught to read, before 
 he can acquire a taste in letters. In New England, 
 the work is half completed. In no other country

VI PREFACE. 
 
 are there so many people, who, in proportion to 
 its numbers, can read and write ; and, therefore, 
 no sooner was a taste for amusing literature diffused, 
 than all orders of country life, with one accord, 
 forsook the sober sermons and practical pieties of 
 their fathers, for the gay stories and splendid im 
 pieties of the traveller and the novelist. The wor 
 thy farmer no longer fatigued himself with Bun- 
 yan s Pilgrim up the hill of difficulty, or through 
 the &amp;lt; slough of despond ; but quaffed wine with 
 Brydone in the hermitage of Vesuvius, or sported 
 with Bruce on the fairy- land of Abyssinia : while 
 Dolly the dairy maid, and Jonathan the hi**d man, 
 threw aside the ballad of the cruel step-mother, 
 over which they had so often wept in cencert, and 
 now amused themselves into so agreeable a terror 
 with the haunted houses and hobgoblins of Mrs. 
 Ratcliffe, that they were both afraid to sleep alone. 
 Although a lover of literature, however frivolous, 
 may be pleasing to the man of letters, yet there 
 are two things to be deplored in it. The first is, 
 that, while so many books are vended, they are 
 not of our own manufacture. If our wives and 
 daughters will wear gauze and ribbands, it is a 
 pity they are not wrought in our own looms. The 
 second misfortune is, that novels, being the picture 
 of the times, the New England reader is insensibly 
 taught to admire the levity, and often the vices, 
 of the parent country. While the fancy is enchant 
 ed, the heart is corrupted. The farmer s daughter, 
 while she pities the misfortune of some modern 
 heroine, is exposed to the attacks of vice, from 
 which her ignorance would have formed her surest 
 shield. If the English novel does not inculcate

 vice, it at least impresses on the young female mind 
 an erroneous idea of the world in which she is to 
 live. It paints the manners, customs, and habits, 
 of a strange country ; excites a fondness for false 
 splendor ; and renders the home-spun habits of her 
 own country disgusting. 
 
 There are two things wanted, said a friend to 
 the author : that we write our own books of amuse 
 ment, and that they exhibit our own manners. 
 Why then do you not write the history of your 
 own life ? The first part of it, if not highly inter 
 esting, would at least display a portrait of New 
 England manners, hitherto unattempted. Your 
 captivity among the Algerines, with some notices 
 of the manners of that ferocious race, so dreaded 
 by commercial powers, and so little known in our 
 country, would at least be interesting ; and I see 
 no advantage which the novel writer can have over 
 you, unless your readers should be of the senti 
 ment of the young lady mentioned by Addison in 
 his Spectator, who, as he informs us, borrowed 
 Plutarch s Lives, and, after reading the first volume 
 with infinite delight, supposing it to be a novel y 
 threw aside the others with disgust, because a man 
 of letters had inadvertently told her the work wa? 
 founded on FACT.

 ARGUMENT, 
 
 Tlie Author gives an Account ofhi$ gallant Jl?ices.- 
 tor, Captain John Underhill,~his arrival in Mas 
 sachusetts) and Persecution by the first Settlers. 
 
 I DERIVE my birth from one of the first emigrants 
 to New England, being lineally descended from 
 captain John Underbill, who came into the Massa 
 chusetts in the year 1630; of ivhom honourable 
 mention is made by that elegant, accurate, and in 
 teresting historian, the Rev. Jeremy Belknap, in 
 his History of New Hampshire. 
 
 My honoured ancestor had early imbibed an ar 
 dent love of liberty, civil and religious, by his ser 
 vice as a soldier among the Dutch, in their glorious 
 and successful struggle for freedom, with Philip 11. 
 of Spain ; in which, though quite a youth, he held 
 a commission in the earl of Leicester s own troop 
 of guards, who was then sent to the assistance of 
 that brave people, by the renowned queen Eliza 
 beth of England.

 The extravagant passion which that princess was 
 supposed to entertain for various male favourites, 
 which occasioned the disgrace of one and the pre 
 mature death of another, while it has furnished a 
 darling theme to the novelist, and has been wept 
 over in the tragic scene, has never yet received 
 the sober sanction of the historian. 
 
 A traditional family anecdote, while it places 
 the aiietion of the queen for Leicester beyond 
 doubt, 1 may not be unpleasing to the learned rea 
 der, and may .benefit the English historiographer. 
 
 it is. well known that this crafty queen, though 
 repeatedly solicited, never efficaciously assisted 
 the Netherlander, until their affairs were appa 
 rently at the lowest ebb, and they in such despe 
 rate circumstances as to offer the sovereignty of 
 their country to her general, the earl of Leicester. 
 Captain Underbill carried the dispatches to Eng 
 land, and delivered them at the office of lord Bur- 
 leigh. The same evening the queen sent for the 
 captain, and, with apparent perturbation, inquired 
 of him, if he was the messenger from Leicester, 
 and whether he had any private dispatches for her. 
 He replied, that he had delivered all his letters to 
 the secretary of state. She appeared much dis 
 appointed, and, after musing some time, said 
 &quot; So, Leicester wants to be a king.&quot; Underbill, 
 who was in the general s confidence, replied, that 
 the Dutch had indeed made the offer of the sove 
 reignty of their country to her general esteeming 
 it a great honour, as they said, to have a subject 
 of her grace for their sovereign. &quot; No.&quot; replied 
 the queen, &quot; it is not the Dutch ; they hate kings 
 and their divine right ; it is the proud Leicester,

 who longs to be independent of his own sovereign, 
 who moves this insolent proposal. Tell him, from 
 me, that he must learn to obey before he is fit to 
 govern. Tell him,&quot; added the queen, softening 
 her voice, &quot; that obedience may make him a king 
 indeed.&quot; Immediately after captain Underbill had 
 taken the public dispatches, the queen sent for him 
 to her privy closet, recalled her verbal message, 
 delivered him a letter for Leicester directed with 
 her own hand, and a purse of one hundred crowns 
 for himself ; charging him to inclose the letter in 
 lead, sink it in case of danger in his passage by 
 sea, and to deliver it privately. On the receipt 
 of this letter, Leicester was violently agitated, and 
 walked his chamber the whole of the ensuing 
 night. Soon after, he resigned his command, and 
 returned to England, animated by the brightest 
 hopes of realizing the lofty suggestions of his am 
 bition. With him captain Underbill returned, and 
 upon the decease, ot the earl of Leicester, attached 
 himself to the fortunes of the earl of Essex, the un 
 fortunate successor to Leicester in the queen s fa 
 vour. He accompanied that gallant nobleman in 
 his successful attack upon Cadiz, and shared his 
 ill fortune in hisffruitjess expedition against Ty 
 ronne, the rebel chief of the revolted clans of Ire 
 land ; and, returning with the earl into England, 
 by his attachment to that imprudent nobleman, 
 sallying into the streets of London in the petty in 
 surrection which cost Essex his head, he was obli 
 ged to seek safety in Holland, until the accession 
 of king James, in 1603, when he applied for par 
 don, and leave to return to his native country, 
 &quot;Bart that monarch entertained such an exalted idea

 of the dignity of kings, and, from policy, affected 
 so great a veneration for the memory of his pre 
 decessor, that no interest of his friends could pro 
 cure his pardon for an offence which, at this day, 
 in this country, would be considered a simple rout 
 or riot, and punished with a small fine. In that 
 age of kingly glory, however, it was supposed to 
 combine treason and blasphemy : treason against 
 the queen in her political capacity, and blasphe 
 my against her as God s representative and vice 
 gerent on earth. 
 
 The reverend Mr. Robinson, with a number of 
 other pious puritans, who fled from the persecuting 
 fury of the English prelates, to Holland, in 1603, 
 dwelt and communed with them a number of years. 
 He was strongly solicited to go with governor Car 
 ver, Elder Brewster, and the other worthies, part 
 of Mr. Robinson s church, to the settlement of Ply 
 mouth, and had partly engaged with them, as their 
 chief military officer ; but captain Miles Standish, 
 his brave fellow-soldier in the Low Countries, un 
 dertaking the business, he declined. 
 
 How he joined governor Winthrop does not ap 
 pear, but he came over to New England with him, 
 and soon after we find him disciplining the Boston 
 militia, where he was held in such high estimation, 
 that he was chosen to represent that town in the 
 general court ; but his ideas of religious toleration 
 being more liberal than those around him, he lost 
 his popularity, and was, on the 20th of November, 
 1637, disfranchised, and eventually banished the 
 jurisdiction of Massachusetts. 
 
 The writers of those times differ as to the par 
 ticular offence for which he was punished. Some

 -aj that it was for holding the antinomian tenets 
 of the celebrated Anne Hutchinson ; others, that 
 the charge against him was for saying, &quot; That the 
 government of Boston were as zealous as the scribes 
 and pharisees, and as Paul before his conversion. 5 * 
 The best account I have been able to collect is, 
 that at the time when the zeal of our worthy fore 
 fathers burned the hottest against heretics and sec 
 taries ; when good Roger Williams, who settled 
 Providence, the pious Wheelwright, and others, 
 were banished ; he (with about sixty other im 
 prudent persons, who did not believe in the then 
 popular argument of fines, imprisonment, disfran- 
 chisement, confiscation, banishments, and halters 
 for the conversion of infidels) supposed that the 
 Christian faith, which had spread so wonderfully 
 in its infancy, when the sword of civil power \vas 
 drawn against it, needed not the same sword un 
 sheathed in its favour, in an age when it was sur 
 rounded by numerous proselytes. These mista 
 ken people signed a remonstrance against the vio 
 lent proceedings which were the order of that day. 
 William Aspinwall and John Coggeshell, two of 
 the Boston representatives, who signed the remon 
 strance, were sent home, and the town ordered to 
 choose others in their room. Some of the remon 
 strants recanted, some were fined, some were dis- 
 iranchised, and others, among whom was captain 
 Underbill, were banished. 
 
 It is said by some authors, that he was charged 
 with the heinous crime of adultery, and that he 
 even confessed it. The candid American author 
 above named has fallen into this error. As I am 
 sure it must have given him pain to sneak cell

 even of the dead, so I am certain he will rectify 
 the mistake in the next edition f his invaluable 
 history. 
 
 That author informs us, in page 43 of his first 
 volume, &quot; That he, captain Underhill, was pri 
 vately dealt with, on suspicion of adultery, which 
 he disregarded ; and therefore on the next sab 
 bath was questioned for it before the church ; but 
 the evidence not being sufficient to convict him, 
 the church could only admonish him.&quot; Page 45, 
 &quot; He went to Boston, and in the same public man 
 ner acknowledged his adultery. But his confes 
 sion was mixed with so many excuses and exten 
 uations, that it gave no satisfaction.&quot; 
 
 The unwary reader would perhaps conclude, 
 that actual adultery was intended, as well as ex 
 pressed, in these extracts. The reverend author 
 himself did not advert to the idea, that the moral 
 law of Boston, in 1637, was not so lax as the 
 moral law of the same place in 1784, as explained 
 by the practice of its inhabitants. The rigid 
 discipline of our fathers of that era often construed 
 actions, expressions, and sometimes thoughts, into 
 crimes ; which actions, in this day, even the most 
 precise would consider either innocent, indiffer 
 ent, or beneath the dignity of official notice. 
 The fact is, that captain Underhill, so far from 
 confessing, was never charged with committing, 
 actual statute-book adultery. At a certain lecture 
 in Boston, instead of noting in his Bible the 
 texts referred to, according to the profitable custom 
 of the times, this gallant soldier had fixed his eyes 
 steadfastly, and perhaps inordinately, upon one 
 mistress Miriam Wilbore ; who it seems was,

 at that very time, herself in the breach of the 
 spirit of an existing law, which forbade women 
 to appear in public with uncovered arms and 
 necks, by appearing at the same lecture with a 
 pair of wanton open worked gloves, slit at the 
 thumbs and fingers, for the conveniency of taking 
 snuff: though she was not charged with this lat 
 ter crime of using tobacco. It was the adultery 
 of the hearty then of which my gallant ancestor 
 was accused, and founded on that text of Scrip 
 ture, &quot; Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust 
 after her, hath committed adultery with her al^ 
 ready in his heart.&quot;

 It should be premised, that in the year 1636, 
 the governor, deputy governor, three assistants, 
 and three ministers (among whom was Hugh Pe

 for his adherance to Oliver Cromwell,) were en 
 treated by the Massachusetts court to make a

 ined, touching a certain act of adultery I had com 
 mitted wilh one mistress Miriam Wilbore, wife 
 of Samuel Wilbore, for carnally looking to luste 
 after her, at the lecture in Boston, when master 
 Shepherd expounded. This mistress Miriam hath 
 since been dealte with for coming to that lecture 
 wilh a pair of wanton open workt gloves, slit at 
 (he thumbs and fingers, for the purpose of taking 
 snuff ; for, as master Cotton observed, for what 
 end should those vaine opennings be, but for ,the 
 intent of taken filthy snuff? and he quoted Gregory 
 Nazianzen upon good works. Master Peters said, 
 that these opennings were Satan s. port-holes of firy 
 temptatione. Mistress Miriam offerd in excuse of 
 her vain attire&amp;gt; that she was newle married, and 
 appeard in her bridall arraye. Master Peters said 
 that marriage was the occasion that the devil tooke 
 io caste his fiery darts, and lay his pit-falls of 
 temptation, to catch frale flesh and bloode. She 
 is to be further dealt with for taken snuff. How the

 on captain Underhill, he returned to Dover in New 
 Hampshire, and was there elected governor of thr 
 European settlers ; but notwithstanding his great 
 , e ;ervice to the people of Massachusetts in the Pe- 
 quod wars, his persecutors in Boston would not 
 allow him to die in peace ; for, by writing injuri 
 ous letters to those he governed, by threats of their 
 power, and by determining that Dover was within 
 the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, they forced him 
 to flee to Albany, then possessed by the Dutch, un 
 der the name of Amboyna. 
 
 The Dutch were highly pleased with the cap

 of one hundred and twenty men, in their wars with 
 the natives. It is said that he killed one hundred 
 and fifty Indians on Long Island, and upwards of 
 three hundred on the Main. The laurels of the 
 famous colonel Church wither in this comparison. 
 The Dutch granted him fifty thousand acres of - 
 land, then in their possession. Although the En 
 glish, when they took possession of that country 
 for the duke of York, afterwards James the Sec 
 ond, had promised to quiet the claims of the set* 
 tiers, yet captain Underbill or his posterity have 
 never availed themselves of the grant. When I 
 mentioned this circumstance some time since in 
 Hertford, certain gentlemen immediately offered to 
 raise a company and purchase my right. I can~ 
 didly confessed that I was not possessed of the ti 
 tle, and knew not the particular spot where the 
 land lay, and consequently was unwilling to sell 
 land without title or boundaries. To my surprise 
 they laughed ctt my scruples, and observed that 
 they wanted the land to speculate upon ; to sell, 
 and not to settle. Titles and boundaries, in such 
 cases, I understood were indifferent matters, mere 
 trifles. 
 
 My- brave ancestor, at an advanced age, died 
 in Albany, leaving two sons ; the youngest of 
 whom removed to the Mouth of Hudson, where 
 some of his posterity flourish respectably to this 
 day. The eldest son, Benoni, from whom I am 
 descended, some years after his father s decease, 
 after being the subject of various misfortunes, re 
 turned in impoverished circumstances to New 
 Hampshire, where the family have continued ever 
 since.

 I WAS born on the 16th of July, A. D. 1762. My 
 mother, some months before my birth, dreamt that 
 she was delivered of me ; that I was lying in the 
 cradle ; that the house was beset by Indians, who 
 broke into the next room, and took me into the 
 fields with them ; that, alarmed by their hideous 
 yellings and war whoops, she ran to the window, 
 and saw a number of young tawny savages playing 
 at foot-ball with my head ; while several sachems 
 and sagamores were looking on unconcerned.

 Providence through the intervention of dreams. 
 Is not the modern Christian equally the care of 
 indulgent heaven as the favoured Jew or the be- 
 Joved patriarch ? 
 
 Many modern examples of the foreboding vi 
 sions of the night may be adduced. William 
 Phipps, a poor journeyman ship-carpenter, dreamt, 
 that he should one day ride in his coach, and live 
 in a grand house near Boston common. Many 
 years afterwards, when he was knighted by Wil 
 liam the Third, and came from England governor 
 of Massachusetts Bay, this dream, even as to the 
 situation of the grand house, was literally and 
 minutely fulfilled. If the insect infidels of the 
 day doubt this fact, let them consult, for their edi 
 fication, the learned doctor Mather s Magnalia, 
 where the whole story at large is minutely and 
 amply related. It was the error of the times of 
 monkish ignorance to believe every thing ; it may

 IN my childhood I was sent, as is customary, to 
 a woman s school in the summer, and to a man s 
 in the winter season, and made great progress in 
 such learning as my preceptors dealt in. About 
 my twelfth year, our minister, who made it his cus 
 tom to inspect the schools annually, came to our dis 
 trict. My master, who looked upon me as his best 
 scholar, directed me to read a lesson in Dilworth s 
 spelling-book, which I recited as loud as I could 
 speak without regard to emphasis or stops. This 
 so pleased our minister, who prided himself on the 
 strength of his own lungs, that, a short time after, 
 coming to my father s to dicker , as they styled it, 
 about a swap of cattle, and not finding my father 
 sharp at the bargin, he changed the discourse up 
 on me, observing, &quot;how delighted he was with my 
 performances at school. What a pity it was such 
 a genius was not encouraged I Mr. Underbill,

 you must put Updike to learning.&quot; My lather 
 pleaded poverty. &quot; When 1 went to Harvard col 
 lege,&quot; replied the minister, &quot; I was poor indeed. 
 I had no father with a good farm to assist me ; 
 but, with being butler s freshman, and ringing the 
 bell the first year, waiter the three last, and keep 
 ing school in the vacations, I rubbed through, and 
 am now what I am ; and who knows,&quot; continued 
 he, &quot; but when Updike has completed his educa 
 tion, he may make a minister ; and possibly, 
 when my usefulness is over, supply our very 
 pulpit?&quot; . 
 
 lily mother here interfered. She was a little, 
 spare woman. My father was a large bony man, 
 famous, in his youth, for carrying the ring at 
 wrestling; and, in his latter years, for his perse 
 verance at town meetings. But, notwithstanding 
 my father s success in carrying points abroad, my 
 mother, some how or other, contrived always to 
 carry them at home. My father never would ac- 
 knewledge this ; but when a coarse neighbour 
 would sometimes slily hint the adage of the grey 
 mare being the better horse, he would say to his 
 particular friends, that he always was conqueror 
 in his domestic warfare : but would confess that 
 he loved quiet, and was of late tired of perpetu 
 ally getting the victory. My mother joined the 
 minister, observing that Updike should have 
 learning, though she worked her hands to the bone 
 to procure it. She did not doubt, when he came 
 to preach, he would be as much run after as the 
 great Mr. Whitfield. &quot; I always- thought,&quot; con 
 tinued she, u the child was a genius ; and al

 boy loves books. He has read Valentine and 
 Orson, and Robinson Crusoe. I went, the other 
 day, three miles to borrow Pilgrim s Progress for 
 him. He has read it through every bit ; ay, and 
 understands it too. Why, he stuck a skewer 
 through Apollyon s eye in the picture, to help 
 Christian beat him. My father could not- answer 
 my mother s argument. The dicker about the oxen 
 was renewed ; and it was concluded to swap even, 
 though my father s were much the likelier cattle ; 
 and that I should go that week and study Latin 
 with the minister, and be fitted for college. 
 
 With him I studied four years, labouring inces 
 santly at Greek and Latin : as to English gram- 
 Hiar, my preceptor, knowing nothing of it him 
 self, could communicate nothing to me. As he 
 was enthusiastically attached to the Greek, and 
 had delivered an oration in that language at the 
 commencement at Cambridge, when he took his 
 first degree, I, by his direction, committed to me 
 mory above four hundred of the most sonorous lines 
 in Homer, which I was called to repeat before a 
 number of clergymen, who visited him at an an 
 nual convention in our parish. These gentlemen 
 were ever pleased to express astonishing admira 
 tion at my literary acquirements. One of them 
 prognosticated that I should be a general, from 
 the fire and force with which I recited Homer s 
 battles of the Greeks and Trojans. Another ar 
 gued that I should be a member of congress, and 
 equal the Adams s in oratory, from my repeating 
 the speeches at the councils of the heathen gods with 
 such attention to the caesura. A third was sure 
 that I should become a Witherspoon in divinity-.

 from the pathos with which I declaimed Jupiter s 
 speech to all the gods. In fine, these gentlemen 
 considered the classics the source of all valuable 
 knowledge. With them dead languages were 
 more estimable than living ; and nothing more 
 necessary to accomplish a young man for all that 
 is profitable and honourable in life than a profound 
 knowledge of Homer. One of them gravely obser 
 ved that he was sure general Washington read 
 Greek ; and that he never would have captured the 
 Hessians at Trenton, if he had not taken his plan 
 of operation from that of Ulysses and Diomede 
 seizing the horses of Rhesus, as described in the 
 tenth book of the Iliad. 
 
 , Thus flattered by the learned that I was in the 
 high road to fame, I gulped down portions of 
 Greek daily, while my preceptor made quarterly 
 visits to my father s barn-yaad for pay for my in 
 struction. 
 
 In June, 178b, my father began seriously to 
 think of sending me to college. He called upon 
 a neighbour, to whom he had sold part of his 
 farm, for some cash. His creditor readily paid 
 down the whole sum due, in paper money ; and 
 my father found, to his surprise, that the value of 
 three acres paid him the principal and interest of 
 the whole sum, for which he had sold seventy -five 
 acres of land five years before. This was so se 
 vere a stroke of ill fortune, that it entirely frustra 
 ted the design of sending ine to college.

 ARGUMENT. 
 
 This Chapter containeth an Eulogy on the Greek 
 Tongue. 
 
 WHAT added to the misfortune mentioned in the 
 last chapter was, that a worthy divine, settled in 
 Boston, passing through our town, told my father, 
 in a private conversation, that al! the Greek I had 
 acquired was of no other service than fitting me 
 for college. My father was astonished. He was 
 a plain unlettered man, of strong natural abilities. 
 &quot; Pray, reverend sir,&quot; said my father, &quot; do they 
 not learn this Greek language at college ? If 
 0, why do such wise men as the governors 
 of colleges teach boys what is entirely useless ? 
 1 thought that the sum of all good education was, 
 to teach youth those things which they were to 
 practise in after life.&quot; &quot; Learning,&quot; replied our 
 enlightened visitor, &quot; has its fashions ; and, like 
 other fashions of this world, they pass away. 
 When our forefathers founded the college at Cam 
 bridge, crrtical knowledge in the mazes and 
 subtleties of school divinity was all the mode. 
 He that could give a new turn to an old text, 
 or detect a mistranslation in the version, was 
 more admired than the man who invented printing, 
 discovered the magnetic powers, or contrived an 
 instrument of agriculture which should abridge the 
 labour of the husbandman. The books of our faith-,

 with the voluminous commentaries of the fathers, 
 being originally written in what are now called 
 the dead languages, the knowledge of those langua 
 ges was then necessary for the accomplishment of 
 the fashionable scholar. The moderns of New 
 England have ceased to interest themselves in the 
 disputes, whether a civil oath may be administered 
 to an unregenerate man ; or whether souls, existing 
 merely in the contemplation of Deity, are capable 
 of actual transgression. Fashion has given a new 
 direction to the pursuits of the learned. They no 
 longer soar into the regions of infinite space ; but 
 endeavour, by the aid of natural and moral philoso 
 phy, to amend the manners and better ihe condition 
 of man : and the college at Cambridge may be 
 assimilated to an old beau, with his pocket-holes 
 under his arm-pits, the skirts- of his coat to his an 
 kles, and three gross of buttons on his breeches ; 
 looking with contempt on the more easy useful 
 garb of the present day, for deviating from what 
 was fashionable in his youth. * 
 
 &quot; But,&quot; inquired my father, &quot; is there not 
 some valuable knowledge contained in those 
 Greek books ?&quot; &quot; All that is useful in them,&quot; replied 
 our visitor, &quot; is already translated into English ; 
 and more of the sense and spirit may be imbibed 
 from translations than most scholars would be able 
 to extract from the originals, if they even availed 
 themselves of such an acquaintance with that lan 
 guage as is usually acquired at college. 
 
 &quot; Well&quot; replied my father, &quot; do you call their, 
 dead laguages. It appears to me now, that con-

 youth, is like the ingenious cruelty of those tyrants 
 I have heard of, who chained the living and the 
 dead together. If Updike went to college, I 
 should wish he would learn, not hard zvords but 
 useful things&quot; 
 
 * You spake of governors of colleges,&quot; contin 
 ued our visitor. &quot; Let me observe, as an apology 
 for the concern they may be supposed to have 
 in this error, that they are moral worthy men, who 
 have passed the same dull routine of education, and 
 whose knowledge is necessarily confined to these 
 defunct languages. They must teach their pupils 
 what they know, not what they do not know. 
 That measure which was measured unto them, 
 they mete out most liberally unto others.&quot; 
 
 &quot; Should not the legislature, as the fathers of the 
 people, interfere ?&quot; inquired my father. &quot; We 
 will not talk politics at this time,&quot; replied our 
 visitor. 
 
 My father was now determined that I should 
 not go to college. He concealed this conversation 
 from me, and 1 was left to be proud of my Greek. 
 The little advantage this deceased &amp;gt; language has 
 since been to me has often caused me sorely to 
 regret the inispending of the time in acquiring it. 
 The French make it no part of their academical 
 studies. Voltaire, d Alembert, and Diderot, when 
 they completed their education, were probably 
 ignorant of the cognata te.mpora of a Greek verb. 
 
 It was re?olved that I should labour on my fa 
 ther s farm ; but, alas ! a taste for Greek had quite 
 eradicated a love for labour. Poring so intensely 
 on Homer and Virgil had so completely tilled my 
 brain with the heathen mythology, that I hnagin*

 ed a hamadryad in every sapling, a nai ad in every 
 puddle ; and expected to hear the sobbings of the 
 infant fauns as I turned the furrow. I gave Greek 
 names to all our farming tools, and cheered the 
 cattle with hexameter verse. My father s hired 
 men, after a tedious day s labour in the woods, 
 inspecting our stores for refreshment, instead of the 
 customary bread and cheese and brandy, found 
 Homer s Iliad, Virgil Delphini, and Schrevelius s 
 Lexicon, in the basket. 
 
 After I had worked on the farm some months, 
 having killed a fat heifer of my father s, upon 
 which the family depended for their winter s beef, 
 covered it with green boughs, and laid it in the 
 shade to putrefy, in order to raise, a swarm of bees* 
 after the manner of Virgil which process, not

 How was my heart dilated with the prospect, 
 in the tedious interval previous to my entering up 
 on my school ! How often have 1 stood suspended 
 over my dungfork, and anticipated my scholars, 
 seated in awful silence around me, my arm-chair 
 and birchen sceptre of authority ! There was an 
 echo in my father s sheep pasture. More than 
 once I have repaired there alone, and exclaimed, 
 with a loud voice, Is master Updike Underbill at 
 home ? I would speak with master Underbill ! for 
 the pleasure of hearing how my title sounded. 
 Dost thou smile, indignant reader ? pause, and re 
 collect if these sensations have not been familiar 
 to thee, at some time in thy life. If thou answer- 
 est disdainfully no then I aver thou hast never 
 been a corporal in the militia, nor a sophomore at 
 college. 
 
 At times I however entertained less pleasing, 
 but more rational, contemplations on my prospects. 
 As I had been once unmercifully whipped, for 
 detecting my master in a false concord, I resolved 
 to be mild in my government, to avoid all manu 
 al correction, and doubted not by these means to 
 secure the love and respect of my pupils. 
 
 In the interim of school hours, and in those 
 peaceful intervals when my pupils were engaged 
 in study, I hoped to indulge myself with my fa 
 vourite Greek. I expected to be overwhelmed 
 with the gratitude of their parents, for pouring the 
 fresh instruction over the minds of their children, 
 and teaching their young ideas how to shoot. I 
 anticipated independence from my salary, which 
 was to be equal to four dollars, hard money, per 
 month, and my boarding : and expected to fin&amp;lt;[

 amusement and pleasure among the circles of the 
 young, and to derive information and delight from 
 the classic converse of the minister. 
 
 In due time my ambition &amp;gt;vns gratified, and I 
 placed at the head of a school, consisting of about 
 sixty scholars. Excepting three or four overgrown 
 boys of eighteen, the generality of them were un 
 der the age of seven years. Perhaps a more rag 
 ged, ill-bred, ignorant set, never were collected, 
 for the punishment of a poor pedagogue. To 
 study in school was impossible. Instead of the 
 silence I anticipated, there was an incessant clam 
 our. Predominant among the jarring sounds were 
 Sir, may I read ? May 1 spell ? Master may I 
 go out? YVill master mend my pen ? What with 
 the pouting of the small children, sent to school 
 not to learn, but to keep them out of harm s way, 
 and the gruff surly complaints of the larger ones, 
 I was nearly distracted. Homer s poluphloisboio 
 tkalasses, roariiig sea, was a whisper to it. My 
 resolution to avoid beating them made me invent 
 small punishments, which often have a salutary 
 impression on delicate minds ; but they were in 
 sensible to shame. The putting of a paper fool s- 
 cap on one, and ordering another under my great 
 chair, only excited mirth in the school ; which the 
 very delinquents themselves often increased by 
 loud peals of laughter. Going one frosty morning, 
 into my school, I found one of the larger boys 
 sitting by the fire in my arn&amp;gt;chair. I gently re 
 quested him to remove. He replied that he would, 
 when he had warmed himself : &quot; father finds 
 wood, and not you.&quot; To have my throne usurp 
 ed, in the face of the whole school, shock my gov

 ernment to the centre. I immediately snatched 
 my two-foot rule, and laid it pretty smartly across 
 his back. He quitted the chair, muttering that he 
 would tell father. I found his threats of more 
 consequence than I apprehended. The same af 
 ternoon, a tall raw-boned man called me to the 
 door : immediately collaring me with one hand, 
 and holding a cart-whip over my head with the 
 other, with fury in his face, he vowed he would 
 whip the skin from my bones if ever I struck Jo* 
 tham again : ay, he would do it that very moment, 
 if he was not afraid I would take the law of him. 
 This was the only instance of the overwhelming 
 gratitude of parents I received. The next day it 
 was reported all over town what a cruel man the 
 master was. &quot; Poor Jotham came into school, 
 half frozen and near fainting ; master had been 
 *itting a whole hour by the warm fire ; he only 
 begged him to let him warm himself a little, 
 when the master rose in a rage, and cut open his 
 head with the tongs, and his life was despair 
 ed of.&quot; 
 
 Fatigued with the vexations of my school, I 
 one evening repaired to the tavern, and mixed 
 with some of the young men of the town. Their 
 conversation I could not relish ; mine they could 
 not comprehend. The subject of race-horses be 
 ing introduced, I ventured to descant upon Xan- 
 thus, the immortal courser of Achilles. They 
 had never heard of squire Achilles or his horse ; 
 but they offered to bet two to one that Bajazet, 
 the Old Roan, or the deacon s mare, Pumpkin 
 and Milk, would beat him, and challenged me t&amp;lt;? 
 appoint time and place*

 Nor was I more acceptable among the young 
 women. Being invited to spend an evening, after 
 a quilting, I thought this a happy opportunity 
 to introduce Andromache, the wife of the great 
 Hector, at her loom ; and Penelope, the faithful 
 wife of Ulysses, weaving her seven years web. 
 This was received with a stupid stare, until I 
 mentioned the long time the queen of Ulysses 
 was weaving ; when a smart young woman de 
 served, that she supposed miss Penelope s yarn 
 was rotten in whitening, that made her so long : 
 and then told a tedious story of a piece of cotton 
 and linen she had herself woven, under the same 
 circumstances. She had no sooner finished, than, 
 to enforce my observations, I recited above forty 
 lines of Greek from the Odyssey, and then be 
 gan a dissertation on the ccesura. In the midst of 
 my harangue, a florid-faced young man at the 
 further end of the room, with two large promi 
 nent foreteeth, remarkably white, began to sing, 
 
 &quot; Fire upon the mountains ! run, boys, run . &quot; 
 
 and immediately the whole company rushed for 
 ward to see who should get a chance in the reel 
 of six. 
 
 I was about retiring, fatigued and disgusted, 
 when it was hinted to me, that I might wait on 
 miss Mima home ; but as I could recollect no 
 word in the Greek which would construe into 
 bundling, or any of Homer s heroes who got the 
 bag, I declined. In the Latin, it is true, that ^Ene 
 as and Dido, in the cave, seem something like a

 the next day, that master was a papisk, as he had 
 talked French two hours. 
 
 Disappointed of recreation among the young, 
 my next object was the minister. Here I expec 
 ted pleasure and profit. He had spent many years 
 in preaching for the edification of private fami 
 lies, and was settled in the town in a fit of enthu 
 siasm ; when the people drove away a clergyman, 
 respectable for his years and learning. This he 
 was pleased to call an awakening. He lectured 
 me at the first onset for not attending the confe 
 rence and night meetings ; talked much of gifts, 
 and decried human learning as carnal and devilish ; 
 and well he might, he certainly was under no ob 
 ligations to it; for a new singing master coming 
 into town, the young people, by their master s ad 
 vice, were for introducing Dr. Watts s version of 
 the Psaims. Although I argued with the minister 
 an hour, he remains firmly convinced to this day, 
 that the version of Sternhold and Hopkins is the 
 same in language, letter, and metre, with those 
 psalms king David chanted in the city of Jerusa 
 lem. 
 
 As for the independence I had founded on my 
 friges, it vanished like the rest of my scholastic 
 prospects. I had contracted some debts. My re 
 quest for present payment was received with as 
 tonishment. I found I was not to expect it until 
 the next autumn, and then not in cash, but pro 
 duce ; to become my own collector, and pick up 
 my dues, half a peck of corn or rye in a place. 
 ,. I was almost distracted, and yearned for the ex 
 pi ration of my contract* when an unexpected pe~

 that, by the carelessness of the boys, the school- 
 house was burrit down. The common cry now 
 was, that I ought in justice to pay for it, as to my 
 want of proper government the carelessness of the 
 boys ought to be imputed. The beating of Jo- 
 tbam was forgotten, and a thousand stories of my 
 want of proper spirit circulated. These reports, 
 and even the loss of a valuable Gradus ad Parnas- 
 sum, did not damp my joy. I am sometimes led 
 to believe, that my emancipation from real slavery 
 in Algiers did not afford me sincerer joy than I 
 experienced at that moment. 
 
 I returned to rny father, who received me with 
 kindness. My mother heard the story of my dis 
 comfitures with transport ; as she said she had no 
 doubt that her dream about my falling into tLe 
 hands of savages was now out.

 .John Locke, who dissected the human mind, and 
 discovered the circulation of the soul, had, in the 
 full exercise of his understanding, played at duck 
 and drake on the Thames with his gold watch, 
 while he gravely returned the pebble-stone which 
 he held in his other hand into his fob ; and that

 I was allowed the choice of my profession, to

 riched his mind by reading to him, in succession, 
 two hours every day, from the best authors. His 
 sense of feeling was astonishingly delicate, and his 
 hearing, if possible, more acute. His senses of 
 taste and smelling were not so remarkable. After 
 the customary salutation of shaking hands with a 
 stranger, he would know a person by the touch of 
 the same hand several years after, though absent 
 in the interim. He could read a book or news 
 paper, newly printed, tolerably well, by tracing, 
 with the tip of his finger, the indents of the types. 
 He acquired a knowledge of the letters of the 
 alphabet early from the prominent letters on the 
 gingerbread alphabets of the baker. He was 
 master of music, and had contrived a board, perfo* 
 rated with many gimblet holes, and with the assist 
 ance of a little bag of wooden pegs, shaped at 
 top according to his directions, he could prick al 
 most any tune, upon its being sung to him. When 
 in a large company, who sat silent, he could dis 
 tinguish how many persons were present, by not 
 ing, with his ear, their different manner of breath^ 
 ing. By the rarity or density of the air, not per

 He was an unfeigned believer in the salutary

 enthusiasm. You observed, the other day, as we 
 were walking on this plain, my friend addressing 
 himself to me, as I was intimate in the family, 
 that you knew a certain person by his gait, when 
 at so great a distance that you could not discern 
 his features. From this you took occasion to ob- 
 seive, that you saw the master-hand of the great 
 Creator in the obvious difference that was between 
 man and man : not only the grosser difference be 
 tween the Indian, the African, the Esquimeaux, 
 #nd the white man ; but that which distinguishes 
 and defines accurately men of the same nation, 
 and even children of the same parents. You ob 
 served, that as all the children of the great family 
 of the earth were compounded of similar mem 
 bers, features, and lineaments, how wonderfully 
 it displayed the skill of the Almighty Artist to 
 model such an infinite variety of beings, and dis 
 tinctly diversify them, from the same materials. 
 You added, that the incident you had noticed gave 
 fresh instance of admiration ; for you was now 
 convinced that if even all men had been formed 
 of so near resemblance as not to be discerned from 
 each other when at rest, yet when in motion, from 
 their gait, air, and manner, they might readily be 
 distinguished. While you spoke, I could perceive 
 that you pitied me as being blind to a wonderful 
 operation of creative power. I too, in my turn, 
 could triumph. J31ind as I am, I have discovered 
 a still minuter, but as certain a distinction between 
 the children of men, which has escaped the touch 
 of your eyes. Bring me five men, perfect stran 
 gers to me ; pair the nails of the same finger so 
 as to be even with the fingers ends ; let me touch,

 with the tip of my finger, the nails thus prepared : 
 tell me each person s name as he passes in contact 
 before me ; bring the same persons to me one 
 month afterwards with their nails paired in the 
 same manner, and I will call every one by his 
 right name. For be assured, my friend, that Art 
 ist who has denied to me that thing called light, 
 hath opened the eyes of my mind, to know that 
 there is not a greater difference between the Afri 
 can and the European, than what 1 could discov 
 er between the finger-nails of all the men of this 
 world. This experiment he afterwards tried with 
 uniform success. It was amusing, in a gayer hour, 
 to hear him argue the superiority of the touch to 
 the sight. Certainly, the feeling is a nobler sense 
 than that you call sight. 1 inter it from the care 
 nature has taken of the former, and her disregard 
 to the latter. The eyes are comparatively poor, 
 puny, weak organs. A small blow, a mote, or a 
 straw, may reduce those who see with them to a 
 situation as pitiable as mine, while feeling is dif 
 fused over the whole body. Cut off my arm, and 
 a sense of feeling remains. Completely dismem 
 ber me, and while I live I possess it. It is co 
 existent with life itself. 
 
 The senses of smelling and taste are but mod 
 ifications of this noble sense, distinguished, through 
 the inaccuracy of men, by other names. The fla 
 vour of the most delicious morsel is felt by the 
 tongue ; and, when we smell the aromatic, it is 
 the- effluvia of the rose which comes in contact 
 with the olfactory nerves. You that enjoy sight 
 inadvertently confess its inferiority. My brother, 
 honing his penknife the other day, passed it over

 bis thumb nail to discover if the edge was smooth. 
 I heard him, and inquired why he did not touch 
 it with his eyes, as he did other objects. He con 
 fessed that he could not discover the gaps by the 
 sight. Here the superiority of the most inaccu 
 rate seat of the feeling was manifest. To con 
 clude, he would archly add in marriage, the 
 most important concern in life, how many misera 
 ble of both sexes, are left to deplore in tears their 
 dependance on this treacherous thing called sight. 
 From this danger I am happily secured, contin 
 ued he smiling and pressing the hand of his cous 
 in who sat beside him a beautiful blooming 
 young woman of eighteen, who had been bred 
 with him from childhood, and whose affection for 
 him was such, that she was willing, notwithstand 
 ing his blindness, to take him as a partner for 
 life. They expected shortly to be married. Not 
 withstanding his accuracy and veracity upon sub 
 jects he could comprehend, there were many on 
 which he was miserably confused. He called 
 sight the touch of the eyes. He had no adequate 
 idea of colours. White, he supposed, was like 
 the feeling of down ; and scarlet he resembled to 
 the sound of martial music. By passing his hand* 
 over the porcelain, earthern, or plaster of Paris 
 images, he could readily conceive that they were 
 representations of men or animals. But he could 
 have no idea of pictures. I presented him a large 
 picture of his grandfather, painted with oil-colours 
 on canvass ; told him whose resemblance it was ; 
 he passed his hand over the smooth surface and 
 mused : he repeated this, exclaimed it was won

 Upon this young man, my preceptor operated 
 successfully. 1 was present during the whole pro 
 cess, though few were admitted. Upon the intro 
 duction of the couching instrument, and the remo 
 val of the film from the retina, he appeared con 
 fused. When the operation was completed, and 
 he was permitted to look around him, he was vi 
 olently agitated. The irritability of the ophthal 
 mic muscles faintly expressed the perturbation of 
 his mind. After two-and-twenty years of total 
 darkness, to be thus awakened to a new world of 
 sensation and light, to have such a flood of day 
 poured on his benighted eye-balls, overwhelmed 
 him : the infant sight was too weak for the shock, 
 and he fainted. The doctor immediately inter 
 cepted the light with the proper bandages, and, by 
 the application of volatiles, he was revived. The 
 next day the dressings were removed : he had for 
 tified his mind and was more calm. At first he 
 appeared to have lost more than he had gained 
 by being restored to vision. When blind, he 
 could walk tolerably well in places familiar to him. 
 From sight, he collected no ideas of distance. 
 Green was a colour peculiarly agreeable to the 
 new-born sight. Being led to a window, he was 
 charmed with a tree in full verdure, and extended 
 his arms to touch it, though at ten rods distance. 
 To distinguish objects within reach, he would close 
 his eyes, feel for them with his hands, and then 
 look earnestly upon them. 
 
 According to a preconcerted plan, the third day 
 fijs bandages were removed, in the presence of hie.

 parents, brothers, sisters, friends, and of the ami 
 able lovely girl to whom he was shortly to be mar 
 ried. By his request, a profound silence was to 
 be observed, while he endeavoured to discover the 
 person of her who was the object of his dearest 
 affection. It was an interesting scene. The com 
 pany obeyed his injunction. Not a finger moved, 
 or a breath aspirated. The bandage was then re 
 moved ; and when he had recovered from the con 
 fusion of the instant effusion of light, he passed 
 his eye hastily over the whole group. His sensa 
 tions were novel and interesting. It was a mo 
 ment of importance : for aught he knew, he might 
 find the bosom partner of his future life, the twin 
 soul of his affection, in the fat scullion wench of 
 his father s kitchen, or in the person of the tooth 
 less, palsied, decripit nurse, who held the bason 
 of gruel at his elbow. 
 
 In passing his. eye a second time over the circle, 
 his attention was arrested by his beloved cousin. 
 The agitations of her lovely features, and the 
 evanescent blush on her cheek, would have at 
 once betrayed her to a more experienced eye. 
 He passed his eye to the next person, and imme 
 diately returned it to her. It was a moment big 
 with expectation. Many a finger was raised to 
 the lips of the spectators, and many a look expres 
 sive of the silence she should preserve was cast 
 towards her. But the conflict was too violent for 
 her delicate frame. He looked more intensely ; 
 she burst into tears, and spoke. At the well known 
 voice he closed his eyes, rushed towards her, and 
 clasped her i\i his arms. I envied them their feel 
 ings ; but I thought then, pd do now, that the

 sensations of my preceptor, the skilful humane 
 operator were more enviable. The man who 
 could restore life and usefulness to the darling of 
 his friends, and scatter light in the paths of an 
 amiable young pair, must have known a joy nev 
 er surpassed ; except, with reverence be it spoken, 
 by the satisfaction of our benevolent Saviour, 
 when, by his miraculous power, he opened the 
 eyes of the actually blind, made the dumb to sing, 
 and the lame and impotent leap for joy.

 i man of his acknowledged learning should not 
 sometimes quote Greek. Of my acquirements in 
 that language I was still proud. I attribute the 
 indifference with which it was received in the 
 town where I had kept school to the rusticity and 
 ignorance of the people. As I now moved in the 
 circles of polished life, I ventured sometimes, when 
 the young ladies had such monstrous colds as that 
 they could not by the earnest persuasions of the 
 company be prevailed on to sing, and when it had 
 been frequently observed that it was quaker meet 
 ing, to spout a few lines from the Iliad. It is true 
 they did not interrupt me with 
 
 &quot; Fire upon the mountains ! run, boys, run !&quot; 
 
 but the most sonorous lines of the divine blind bard 
 were received with cold approbation of politeness. 
 One young lady alone seemed pleased. She would 
 frequently ask me to repeat those lines of VVabash 
 poetry ; though once, in the sublime passage of the 
 hero Ulysses hanging fifty young maidens with his 
 own hands, in the Odyssey, I heard the term pe 
 dant pronounced with peculiar emphasis by a beau 
 at my back. If I had taken the hint, and passed my 
 Greek upon my companions for Indian, they would 
 have heard me with rapture. I have since known 
 that worthy indefatigable missionary to the Indians,

 with speeches in the aboriginal language of Amer

 my first essay in metre in an ode addressed to her

 and scattered them with profusion through my ode. 
 I praised her golden locks, and assimilated her 
 to the ox-eyed Juno ; sent her a correct copy, and 
 dispersed a number of others among her friends. I 
 afterwards found, that what I intended as the sub- 
 limest panegyric was received as cutting insult, 
 The golden tresses, and the ox-eyed epithet, the 
 most favourite passages in my poem, were very un 
 fortunate ; as the young lady was remarkable for 
 very prominent eyes, which resembled what, in 
 horses are called wall-eyes. Her hair was what 
 is vulgarly called carroty ; its unfashionable col

 inquired for Mr. Updike Underbill. Upon being 
 informed that I was the person, with two of the 
 most profound bows I had ever seen, he advanced 
 towards me, and, with slow and solemn emphasis, 
 said, &quot; Then, sir, I have the honour to present you 
 
 with a billet from my friend, Mr. Jasper T ,&quot; 
 
 and bowed twice, as stately and low as before. I 
 took the letter, which was as big as a government 
 packet ; and, in the midst of a large folio sheet, 
 
 read the following letter, from Mr. Jasper T , 
 
 a professed admirer of the young lady to whom I 
 had addressed my ode after the manner of the

 Though I was engaged to watch that night with 
 one of my preceptor s customers, yet, as Mr. Jas 
 per T seemed so friendly and civil, I could 
 
 not find it in my heart to refuse him, and replied, 
 that I would, with pleasure, wait upon the gentle 
 man. &quot; Sir,&quot; resumed the bearer, &quot; you are a 
 man of honour, every inch of you, and I am your 
 most obedient, most obsequious, and most humblp 
 servant :&quot; and then, making two profound bows 
 in the shop, and one more at the door, he retired, 
 He was no sooner departed, than I sat down to re- 
 peruse this elegant and very extraordinary billet. 
 I had no particular acquaintance with Mr. Jasper 
 T -, and why he should write to me at all puz 
 zled me. The first part of the letter, I doubted 
 not, contained an approbation of my ode, and a 
 request to be indulged with an explanation of 
 some of its peculiar beauties. I began to recol 
 lect illustrations and parodies from some favourite 
 passages in the s lliad. But what we were to do in 
 wasting a few charges of powder was utterly inex 
 plicable. At one time, indeed, I thought it an 
 invitation to shoot partridges, and bethought my 
 self of scouring a long-barrelled gun, which had 
 descended like an heir, loom in our family ; and 
 had perhaps killed Indians on Long Island, in 
 the hands of my brave ancestor, captain John 
 Underbill. Then again I reflected, that the low- 
 er end of a wharf, in a populous town, was not 
 the most prjfcable place to spring a covey of par 
 tridges. But what puzzled me most was his punc 
 tual attention to hours, and even seconds. My 
 doubts were all clearejl by the entrance of a fellow 
 to whom I communicated the letter. He

 ly,&quot; repeated he coolly, &quot; to fight a duel with 
 Mr. Jasper T - with sword and pistol.&quot; &quot; Pho !&quot; 
 replied I, &quot; you banter. Do look at the conclusion 
 of the letter. Will you make me believe that any 
 man in his senses would conclude with all these 
 expressions of esteem and friendship an invita- 
 tion to give him an opportunity of cutting my 
 throat, or blowing my brains out ?&quot; &quot; You have 
 been bred in yankee land,&quot; replied my fellow- 
 student. &quot; Men of honour are above the common 
 rules of propriety and common sense. This letter, 
 which is a challenge, bating some little inaccura 
 cies of grammar and spelling, in substance, I assure 
 you, would not disgrace a man of the highest hon 
 our ; and, if Mr. Jasper T acts as much the 
 
 man of honour on the wharf as he has on paper, he 
 will preserve the same style of good breeding and 
 politeness there also. While, with one hand, he 
 with a deadly longe, passes his sword through 
 your lungs, he will take his hat off with the other, 
 and bow gracefully to your corps.&quot; &quot; Lord de

 :r^st instruct you. There is no more danger in 
 these town duels than in pounding our great mortar. 
 Why, I fought three duels myself in Carolina be 
 fore I was seventeen years old ; and one was for 
 an affront offered to the negro wench who suckled 
 me : and I declare 1 had rather fight ten more, 
 than pass once, in a stage waggon, over Horse 
 Neck. 1 see your antagonist has offered you to 
 bring a second. I will go with you. When you 
 arrive on the ground, we seconds shall mark out 
 your position to stand in ; and to be sure, as in 
 case of bloodshed we shall come into difficulty, 
 we shall place you at a pretty respectable distance. 
 You will then turn a copper for the first fire ; 
 but I should advise you to grant it to him. This 
 will give him a vast idea ot your firmness and con 
 tempt of danger. Your antagonist, with banish 
 ment from his country, and the gallows staring 
 him in the face, will be sure not to hit you, on 
 his own accouht. The ball will pass at least ten 
 rods over your head. You must then discharge 
 your pistol in the air, and offer him to fire again , 
 as, in the language of the duellist, you will have 
 given him hisliie, so it will be highly inconsistent 
 in him to again attemp^vours.. We seconds shall 
 immediately interfere, and pronounce you both 
 men of honour. The matter jn controversy will

 please with honour ; but, however inoffensive 
 you may have been, if you make such a confession 
 before, you are a man of no honour. You will be 
 posted in the coffee-house for a coward.&quot; Not 
 withstanding the comfortable address of my friend, 
 the thoughts of a premature death, or being crip 
 pled for life, distressed me. Nor was the fear 
 of killing my antagonist, and of what my poor 
 parents would suffer from my being exposed to in 
 famous punishment, less alarming. 1 passed some 
 hours of dreadful anxiety ; when I was relieved 
 from my distress in a way I little apprehended. 
 My challenger, who had lived some years in 
 town as a merchant s clerk, viewing me as a raw 
 lad from the country that would never dare accept 
 his challenge, when his messenger returned \|as 
 petrified with astonishment. When assured that I 
 had excepted his challenge as a man of courage 
 and honour, his heart died within him. His friend 
 had no sooner gone to prepare the pistols, than, 
 by communicating the business as a great secret 
 to two or three female friends, the intended duel 
 was noised about town. XJie justices, select-men, 
 and grand-jurors, convened. Warrants were is 
 sued, and constables dispatched into all quarters.

 IN the circle of my acquaintance there was a young

 wards thirty years of age ; though, by avoiding 
 married parties, mingling with very young com

 girlish lisp, blush, and giggle, she was still endea 
 vouring to ward off that invidious appellation of 
 old maid. Upon good grounds I am led to believe 
 &quot;hat the charity of the tea-table had added to her 
 ; because, from a long acquaintance with

 her, I could never induce her to remember any 
 event, however trivial, which happened before 
 Lexington battle. The girls of my age respect 
 ed me as a man of spirit ; but 1 was more fond of 
 being esteemed as a man of learning. This young 
 lady loved literature, and lamented to me her ig 
 norance of the Greek. I gave her a decided pre 
 ference to her rivals. SJie borrowed books of me, 
 and read them with astonishing rapidity. From 
 my own little library, and from those of my friends, 
 I procured about sixty volumes for her ; among 
 which were Locke on Human Understanding, 
 Stackhcuse s Body of Divinity, and Glass s works, 
 not on cookery, but the benignant works of John 
 Glass, the father of Sandimari and the Sandiman- 
 ians ; in my collection, I did not however omit 
 Pope s Homer, and Dryden s \ r irgil ; and, to my 
 astonishment, though I knew that her afternoons 
 were devoted to the structure of caps and bonnets, 
 she perused those sixty volumes completely, and 
 returned them to me in less than a month. There 
 was one thing peculiarly pleasing to me, as a man 
 of letters, that she never made dog-leaves, or soiled 
 the books ; a slovenly practice, of which even 
 great scholars are sometimes guilty. I would, at 
 times, endeavour to draw her into a conversation 
 upon the authors she had recently perused : she 
 would blush, look down, and say that it did not 
 become a young girl, like her, to talk upon such 
 subjects with a gentleman of my sense. The com 
 pliment it contained ever rendered the apology 
 irresistible. One day she asked me to lend her a 
 dictionary. I immediately procured for her the 
 great doctor Johnson s in two volumes loll.?.

 About three days afterwards she offered to return 
 them. Knowing that a dictionary was a work to 
 which reference was often necessary, and thinking 
 it might be of some service, even to a lady of her 
 learning, I pressed her to keep it longer : when she 
 replied, with the prettiest lisp imaginable, that 
 they were indeed very pretty story-books ; but, 
 since I had lent them to her, she had read them all 
 through twice ; and then inquired, .with the same 
 gentle lisp, if I could not lend her a book called 
 Rolling Belly Lettres. I was in absolute astonish

 carry. This learned young lady was amazingly 
 affronted at my abrupt departure ; but, when the 
 cause of it was explained to her, some months af

 tailor, who courted her niece, to challenge me to 
 fight a duel : he actually penned a challenge up 
 on one of his master s pasteboard patterns ; and I 
 verily believe would have sent it by his second,

 was established as a man of hoceur.

 careless Readers. 
 
 BISGUSTED with the frivolity of the young and the 
 deceit of the antiquated ladies, I no\v applied my 
 self sedulously to my studies. Cullen, Munroe, 
 Boerhaave, and Hunter, were my constant com 
 panions. As I advanced in valuable science, my 
 admiration of the Greek declined. I now found 
 that Machaon and Podalirious, the surgeons of Ho 
 mer, were mere quacks, ignorant of even the appli 
 cation of plasters, or the eighteen-tailed bandage ; 
 and, in botany, inferior to the Indian Powwows ; 
 and that the green ointment of my learned friend 
 doctor Kitteridge would have immortalized a bone- 
 setter in the Grecian era, and transmitted him with 
 Esculapius to a seat among the gods- In justice 
 to that venerable language, and to the learned pro 
 fessors of Cambridge, Yale, and Dartmouth, I will 
 candidly confess, that my knowledge of it was now 
 in the first year of my apprenticeship of some ser 
 vice to me, in now and then finding the root of the 
 labels cyphered on our gallipots. I shall mention 
 a little incident which happened about this time, 
 as it contains a lesson valuable to the reader, if ht

 has penetration enough to discover it, and candour 
 enough to apply it to himself. Though I applied 
 myself closely to my books, yet, as hours of re 
 laxation were recommended by my preceptor, I 
 sometimes indulged in the dance, and in sleighing 
 rides. The latter being once proposed to me, at a 
 time when I was without the means of paying my 
 club, I had retired with discontent to my ehamber 5 
 where I accidentally cast my eyes upon a little 
 old-fashioned duodecirna Bible, with silver clasps, 
 in the corner of my trunk a present from my mo 
 ther at parting, who had recommended the frequent 
 perusal of it, as my guide in difficulty, and con 
 solation in distress. Young people in perplexity 
 always think of home. The Bible reproached me. 
 To remove the uneasy sensation, and for the want 
 of something more agreeable to do, I took up the 
 neglected book. No sooner had I unclasped it, 
 than a guinea dropt from the leaves, which had 
 been deposited there by the generous care of my 
 affectionate mother ; and, by my inexcusable in 
 attention, had lain there undiscovered for more than 
 two years. I hastily snatched the brilliant prize, 
 joined my young companions, and resolved that, in 
 gratitude, 1 would read a chapter in the Bible eve 
 ry remaining day of my life. This resolution I then 
 persevered in a whole fortnight., Whilst I am on 
 this subject, I will observe, thotJgh no zealot, I 
 have since, in the hours of misery and poverty, 
 with which the reader shall be acquainted in the 
 sequel, drawn treasures of support and consolation 
 from that blessed book, more precious than the 
 gems of Golconda, or the gold of Ophir.

 shagreen case of pocket surgical instruments. As 
 it is possible that some friend of his may peruse 
 this work, suffer me to pay him a little tribute of 
 gratitude. He was an unaffected gentleman, and 
 a man of liberal science. In him were united the 
 acute chymist, the accurate botanist, the skilful 
 operator, and profound physician. He possessed 
 all the essence, without the parade of learning. 
 In the most simple language, he would trace the 
 latent disease to its diagnostic ; and, from his lips. 
 subjects the most abstruse were rendered familiar 
 to the unlettered man. Excepting when he was 
 with his pupils, or men of science, I never heard 
 him use a technical term. He observed once, that 
 the bold truth of Paracelsus delighted him, but it 
 partook so much of the speech of our country prac- 
 titioners, that he was disgusted with the pomposity 
 of Theophrastus Bombastus. He was both an in 
 structor and parent to his pupils an instructor ia 
 all the depth of science he possessed, and a tender 
 parent in directing them in the paths of virtue and

 by the peculiar politeness and urbanity of the then

 to my surprise, I found the curiosities of all coun

 of the rude arts, arms and antiquities of the ori

 ARGUMENT. 
 
 The Author mounteth his Nag, and setteth out full

 Country Practitioner. 
 
 IN the autumn of 1785 I returned to my parents, 
 who received me with rapture. My father had 
 reared for me a likely pie- bald mare. Our sad 
 dler equipped me with horse furniture, not forget 
 ting the little saddle-bags, which T richly replen 
 ished with drugs purchased at Boston. With a 
 few books, and my surgeon s instruments in my 
 portmanteau, and a few dollars in my pocket, I sat 
 out, with a light heart, to seek practice, fame, 
 and fortune, as a country practitioner. 
 
 My primary object was to obtain a place of 
 settlement. This 1 imagined an easy task, from 
 my own acquirements and the celebrity of my 
 preceptor. My first stop was at a new township, 
 yet tolerably well stocked with a hardy laborious

 set of inhabitants. Five physicians of eminence 
 had within a few years attempted a settlement in 
 this place. The first fell a sacrifice to strong li 
 quor ; the second put his trust in horses, and was 
 ruined by the loss of a valuable sire ; the third 
 quarrelled with the midwife, and was obliged to 
 remove ; the fourth, having prescribed rather un 
 luckily for a young woman of his acquaintance, 
 grievously afflicted with a tympany, went to the 
 Ohio ; and the last, being a prudent man, who 
 sold his books and instruments for wild land, and 
 raised his own crop of medicine, was actually in 
 the way of making a great fortune ; for, in only 
 ten year s practice, he left at his decease, an es 
 tate both real and personal, which was appraised 
 at one hundred pounds, lawful money. This ac 
 count was not likely to engage the attention of a 
 young man upon whose education twice the sum 
 had been expended. 
 
 In the next town I was assured I might do well 
 as a physician, if I would keep a grog-shop, or let 
 myself as a labourer in the hay season, and keep 
 a school in the winter. The first part of the pro 
 position 1 heard with patience ; but, at the bare 
 mention of a school, I fled the ttywn abruptly. In 
 the neighbouring town they did not want a phy 
 sician,, as an experienced itinerant doctor visited 
 the place every March, when the people had most 
 leisure to be sick and take physic. He practiced 
 with great success, especially in slow consump 
 tions, charged very low, and took his pay in any 
 ihing and every thing. Besides, he carried a 
 mould with him, to run pewter spoons, and was 
 equally good at mending a kettle and a constilu^

 AT length I fixed my residence in a town where 
 four physicians were already in full practice, of 
 such contrariety in theory, that I never knew any 
 two of them agree in any practice but in abus 
 ing me and decrying my skill. It was however 
 four months before I had any practice, except the 
 extracting of a tooth from a corn-fed girl, who 
 spun at my lodgings, and who used to look wist 
 fully at me, and ask, if the doctorer did not think 
 the tooth-ache a sign of love ? and say she felt 
 dreadfully all over : and the application of a 
 young virgin in the neighbourhood, who wished 
 to be favoured with a private lecture upon the vir 
 tues of the savin bush. I verily believe I might 
 have remained there to this day unemployed, if 
 my landlord, a tavern keeper, finding my pay

 sending his boy in violent haste to call me out of 
 meeting, and always vowing I was acute at the

 trade, at length drawn the attention of the people 
 towards me. 
 
 I had now some opportunity of increasing my 
 information, by inspecting the practice of my sen 
 iors. The principal physician had been regular 
 ly educated : as I ha^ been so likewise, he affec 
 ted to pay me some attention on purpose to mor 
 tify those three quacks, who, he said, had picked 
 tip their knowledge, as they did their medicine, 
 by the way-side. He was a very formal man in 
 manners and practice,. He thought fresh air high 
 ly noxious in all diseases. I once visited a patient 
 of his, in dog-days, whose parched tongue and 
 acrid skin denoted a violent fever. I was almost 
 suffocated upon entering the room. The windows 
 were closed, and the cracks stuffed with tow ; the 
 curtains were drawn close round the patient s bed, 
 which was covered with a rug, and three comfort 
 able blankets ; a large fire was made in the room ; 
 the door listed, and the key-hole stopped ; while 
 the doctor gravely administered irritating stimu 
 lants to allay the. fever. He carried a favourite 
 practical author in his bags ; and after rinding the 
 patient s case in the index, pulled out a pair of 
 money scales, and with the utmost nicety, weigh 
 ed off the prescribed dose to the decimal of a dram. 
 He told me, as a great secret, that about thirteen 
 years and one day past, he had nearly destroyed 
 a patient, by administering half a dram of pill 
 cochia more than was prescribed in the books. He 
 was called the learned doctor. 
 
 The practice of the second town physician was 
 directly opposite. He prescribed large doses of 
 the most powerful drugs. If he had been inclin-

 ed to weigh his medicine, I believe it would have 
 been with gross weight rather than troy. He was 
 an untaught disciple of the English Ratcliffe, care 
 less, daring, and often succesful. He was admira 
 ble in nervous cases, rose cancers, and white swel 
 lings. Upon the first symptoms of these stubborn 
 disorders, he would drive them, and the subjects 
 of them to a state of quiescence. He was called 
 the cheap doctor ; because he always speedily 
 cured or killed. 
 
 The third physician dealt altogether in simples. 
 The only compound he ever gave, or took, was 
 buttered flip for a cough. It was said, that, if 
 he did no good, he never did any harm. He was 
 called the safe doctor. 
 
 The fourth physician was not celebrated for be 
 ing learned, safe or cheap ; but he had more prac 
 tice than all the other three together, for he was a 
 musical* man, &nd well gifted in prayer.

 even the same pretensions as the crowned heads of 
 Europe have to their wisdom, power, and great 
 ness. He derived it from his birth ; for he was 
 the seventh son of a seventh son, and his mother 
 was a doctress. He did not indeed bear the name 
 or rank, but I number him with the learned ; as 
 he was sometimes called to visit a patient at that 
 critical interesting period, when the other physi 
 cians had given him over ; but his ordinary prac 
 tice lay wholly among sheep, horses, and cattle. 
 He also could boast of astonishing success, and 
 was as proud and opinionated as the best of them ; 
 and, fo/ aught I know, it was as instructive to hear 
 him talk of his ring-bones, wind-galls, and spavins, 
 as to hear our first physician descant upon his 
 paroxysms and peripneumony. 
 
 Being sent for one day to attend a man whose 
 leg was said to be broken by a fall from a frame at 
 a raising, I found, upon my arrival at the patient s, 
 that a brother of the faculty, from the vicinity, had 
 arrived before me, and completed the operation. 
 He was celebrated for his skill in desperate cases ; 
 and universally allowed to be a man of learning. 
 He had prescribed^ gill of burnt brandy, with a 
 pepper-pod in it, to keep # up the patient s spirits 
 under the operation, andl^ook another himself, 
 to keep his hand steady. He splintered the frac 
 tured limb with the bone of two pair of old-fashion 
 ed stays he had caused to be ript to pieces, and 
 bound round the leg with all the garters in the 
 neighbourhood. He bowed gracefully as I enter 
 ed, and regretted extremely that he had not my 
 assistance in setting the bones ; and, with a loud 
 voice, and the most unparalleled assurance, began

 to lay the case before me, and amplify the oper 
 ation he had performed. Sir, said he, when I 
 came to view the patient, I had little hopes of 
 saving his life. 1 found the two lesser bones of 
 the leg, the musa and the tristis, shivered into a 
 thousand splinters ; while the larger bone, the 
 ambobus, had happily escaped unhurt. Perceiv 
 ing I could scarce refrain from laughing, and was 
 about to speak, Sir, said he, winking upon me, I 
 perceive you are one of us men of science, and 
 1 wish you to suspend your opinion until a pri 
 vate consultation, lest our conversation may alarm 
 the patient too much, for you know, as the learn 
 ed Galen observes, 
 
 Omne quod exit in Hum, sen Graccurn, give La- 
 tinum, Lsse genus neutvum, sic invariabile nomen- 
 
 By the way, nurse, these learned languages arc 
 apt to make the professors of them very thirsty. 
 While the todd^ was making, he proceeded : 
 When I pondered this perilous, piteous, pertina 
 cious, pestiferous, petrifying case, I immediately 
 thought of the directions of the learned doctors 
 Hudibras and M fc Fingal, not forgetting, as the 
 wound was on the leg, the great Cruikshank s 
 church history. When we had drunk our liquor, 
 of which he took four fifths, by his direction a new 
 mug was made a little stronger, and we retired 
 to our consultation. 
 
 I am much obliged to you, said he, for not 
 discovering my ignorance to these people ; though 
 it is ten to one if I had not rather convinced 
 the block-heads of yours, if you had attempted 
 it. A regular bred physician, sometime since.

 attempted this. He declared, over the sick man r s 
 bed, that I was ignorant and presuming. I repli 
 ed that he was a quack ; and offered to leave our 
 pretensions to knowledge to the company, which 
 consisted of a midwife, two experienced nurses, 
 ane some others, not so eminent for learning. He 
 quoted Cullen and Chesselden ; and I Tully and 
 Virgil : until at length, when 1 had nearly ex 
 hausted my stock of cant phrases, and he was gain 
 ing the attention of our judges, I luckily bethought 
 me of Lilly s Grammar. I began Propria qua3 
 Maribus ; and, before 1 had got twenty lines, the 
 opinion of the audience was apparently in my favor. 
 They judged naturally enough that I was the 
 most learned man, because the most unintelligible. 
 This raised the doctor s ire so much, that, from 
 disputing with me, he turned to berate them for 
 a parcel of fools, sots, and old women, to put their 
 Jives in the hands of such an ignoramus as me. 
 This quickly decided the contest in my favour. 
 The old nurses raised their voices, the midwife 
 her broom-stick, and the whole train of mob-cap 
 ped judges their skinny fists, and we drove him 
 out of the house in triumph. Our victory was 
 so complete, that, in the military style, we did 
 not allow him to remain on the field to bury his 
 dead. 
 
 But it is time to tell you who I am. Sir, I 
 drink your health. In brief, sir, I am the son 
 of a respectable clergyman, received a college 
 education, entered into merchandise, failed, and, 
 by a train of misfortunes, was obliged to com 
 mence doctor, for sustenance. I settled myself 
 in this back country. At first I was applied to

 chiefly in desperate cases ; where no reputation 
 is lost if the patient dies, and much gained if 
 he recovers. I have performed some surprising 
 cures ; but how I cannot tell you, except it was 
 by allowing my patients small beer, or any thing 
 else they hankered after, which I have heard 
 was sometimes efficacious in the crisis of a fever. 
 But talking of drink, sir, I wish your health. I 
 believe I have never injured any persons by my 
 prescriptions, as powdered burnt crust, chalk, 
 and juice of beets and carrots, are rny most pow 
 erful medicines. We can be of mutual service 
 to each other. Nurse, another mug. We doc 
 tors find this a very difficult case. As I have 
 borne down these country quacks by superiour 
 effrontery, I can recommend you to full practice. 
 I will call you to consult with me in difficult 
 cases ; for, as I was saying, sir, 1 wish your, 
 good health, mine are all difficult cases ; and you, 
 in return, shall lend me books, and give me 
 such instructions as will enable me to do good, 
 as well as get fame and bread. The proposal 
 was reasonable. I closed with it. He emptied 
 the third mug, and we returned to our patient. 
 When the dressings were removed, I discovered 
 that there was not the slightest fracture of the fib 
 ula or tibia ; but only a slight contusion on the pat- 
 ula, which would perhaps not have alarmed any 
 other person but our patient, who was a rich old 
 bachelor. I recommended an emmollient, Which 
 my learned brother acquisced in, saying, with his 
 usual air, that it was the very application he in 
 tended, having applied the garters and whalebone

 merely to concoct the tristis, the musa, and the 
 arnbobus, firmly together. 
 
 A young girl, at the door, showed him a wound 
 on her elbow, which she had received in strug 
 gling about red cars at a husking ; which he grave- 
 )y pronounced to be a fistula in ano. This gen 
 tleman is rea ly a man of abilities ; has since 
 made valuable acquirements in the knowledge of 
 the human frame, and the materia medica. If 
 he could be led to substitute the aquatic draughts 
 of doctor Sangrado, as a succedaneum for the dif 
 fusible stimuli of Brown, he would become use* 
 fill in the faculty, and yet see happy days. 
 
 The doctor kept his word He read my books, 
 received my instructions, and recommended me to 
 his patients. But as I copied my preceptor, in 
 the simplicity of my language I never attempted 
 to excite the fear of my patients, to magnjfy my 
 skill ; and could not reduce three fractured bones 
 in a limb which contained but two. My advice 
 was little attended to, except when backed with 
 that of my pupil, accompanied with frequent quo 
 tations from Lilly. He obtained all the credit of 
 our success ; and the people generally supposed 
 me a young man of moderate talents, whom the 
 learned doctor might make something of in a 
 course of years.

 A MERRY incident gave,me a perfect insight into the 
 practice of the several physicians I have just eu

 his horse at a public review, was taken up sense 
 less, and extended upon the long table of the tav 
 ern. He soon recovered his breath, and groaned 
 most piteously. As his head struck the ground 
 first, it was apprehended by some, unacquainted 
 with its solidity, that he had fractured his skull. 
 The faculty hastened from all quarters to his as 
 sistance. The learned scrupulous physician, after 
 requesting that the doors and windows might be 
 shut, approached the patient ; and, with a stately 
 air, declined giving his opinion, as he had unfor 
 tunately left at home his 4 Pr ingle on Contusions.* 
 The cheap doctor immediately pronounced the 
 wound a compound fracture, prescribed half a dose 
 of crude opium, and called for the trepanning in 
 struments. The safe doctor proposed brown pa 
 per, dipped in rum and cobwebs, to staunch the 
 blood. The popular physician, the musical doc 
 tor, told Uv a jovial story ; and then suddenly re 
 laxing his features, observed, that he viewed the 
 groaning wretch as a monument of justice : that he

 rny new pupil, pressing through the crowd, begged

 toes ; a drunkard s in his throat : By the way, 
 landlord, give us a button of sling. When we 
 learned wish to know if a wound endangers life, 
 we consequently inquire into the affections of the 
 patient, and see if the wound injures the seat of 
 his soul : if that escapes, however deep and ghast

 under seven years, or until my patients died (in

 practice. To draw upon my father, who had al

 worse. I had often heard the southern states

 told that the inhabitants were immensely opulent, 
 paid high fees with profusion, and were extreme

 New England brethren. By the advice of our

 Anecdotes of Dr. Benjamin Franklin, whom the 
 Author visits in Philadelphia. 
 
 I CARRIED a request to the late Dr. Benjamin 
 Franklin, then president of the state of Pennsylva 
 nia, for certain papers J was to deliver further 
 southward. I anticipated much pleasure from the 
 interview with this truly great man. To see one, 
 who, from small beginnings, by the sole exertion 
 of native genius and indefatigable industry, had 
 raised himself 4o the pinnacle of politics and let 
 ters ; a man who, from an humble printer s boy, 
 had elevated himself to be the desirable compan 
 ion of the great ones of the earth : who, iioin 
 trundling a wheelbarrow in bye lanes, had been 
 advanced to pass in splendour through the courts 
 of kings : and from hawking vile ballads, to the 
 contracting and signing treaties, which gave peace 
 and independence to three millions of his fellow 
 citizens, was a sight interesting in the extreme. 
 
 I found the doctor surrounded by company, 
 most of whom were young people. He received 
 me with the attention due to a young stranger. 
 He dispatched a person for the papers I wanted ; 
 asked me politely to be seated ; inquired after

 the family I sprang from ; and told me a pleasing 
 anecdote of my brave ancestor, captain Underbill. 
 I found in tbe doctor all that simplicity of lan 
 guage which is remarkable in the fragment of 
 his life, published since bis decease, and which 
 was conspicuous in my Medical Preceptor. I 
 have since been in a room a few hours with gov 
 ernor Jay, of New York ; have heard of the hte 
 governor Livingston, of New Jersey ; and am now 
 confirmee 1 in the opinion I have suggested, that 
 men of genuine merit, as they possess the essence, 
 need not the parade of great knowledge. A rich 
 man is often plain in his attire ; and the man who 
 has abundant treasures of learning, simple in his 
 manners and style. 
 
 The doctor, in early life, was economical from 
 principle ; in his latter days perhaps from habit. 
 Poor Richard held the purse-strings of the presi 
 dent of Pennsylvania. Permit me to illustrate 
 this observation by an anecdote. Soon after I was 
 introduced, an airy thoughtless relation, from a 
 New England state, entered the room. It seems 
 he was on a party of pleasure ; and had been so 
 much involved in it, for three weeks, as not to 
 have paid his respects to his venerable relative. 
 The purpose of his present visit was to solicit the 
 loan of a small sum of money, to enable him to 
 pay his bills, and transport himself home. He 
 preluded his request with a detail of embarrass- 
 .rnents which might have befallen the most circum 
 spect. He said that he had loaded a vessel for 
 B ; and, as he did not deal on credit, had pur 
 chased beyond his current cash, and could not

 readily procure a draft upon home. The doctor 
 inquiring how much he wanted, he replied, with 
 some hesitation, fifty dollars. The benevolent old 
 gentleman went to his escritoir, and counted him 
 out a hundred. He received them with many 
 promises of punctual payment and hastily took 
 up the writing implements, to draught a note of 
 hand for the cash. The doctor, who saw into the 
 nature of the borrower s embarrassments better than 
 he was aware, and was possessed with the improb 
 ability of ever recovering his cash again, stepped 
 across the room, and laying his hand gently upon 
 his cousin s arm, said, &quot; Stop, cousin, we will 
 save the paper ; a quarter of a sheet is not of 
 great value, but it is worth saving :&quot; conveying, 
 at once, a liberal gift and gentle reprimand for the 
 borrower s prevarication and extravagance. Since 
 1 am talking of Frank in, the reader may be as 
 unwilling to leave him as I was. Allow me to 
 relate another anecdote. I do not recollect how 
 the conversation was introduced, but a young per 
 son in company mentioned his surprise that the 
 possession of great riches should ever be attended 
 with such anxiety and solicitude ; and instanced 
 Mr. R M , who he said, though in possession 
 of unbounded wealth, yet was as busy and more 
 anxious than the most assiduous clerk in his count 
 ing house. The doctor took an apple from a fruit- 
 basket, and presented it to a little child, who 
 could just totter about the room. The child could 
 scarce grasp it in his hand. He then gave it an 
 other, which occupied the other hand. Then

 ty, he presented that also. The child, after many 
 ineffectual attempts to hold the three, dropped the 
 last on the carpet, and burst into tears. See there, 
 said the philosopher ; there is a little man with 
 more riches than he can enjoy.

 Jenny Driver. When we arrived at the church, 
 we found a brilliant collection of well dressed peo 
 ple, anxiously waiting the arrival of the parson 
 who, it seems, had a small branch of the river 
 
 M to pass ; and, we afterwards learned, was 
 
 detained by the absence of his negro boy, who 
 was to ferry him over. Soon after, our impa 
 tience was relieved by the arrival of the parson in 
 his canonicals-^a young man not of the most mor 
 tified countenance, who, with a switch Called a 
 supple jack in his hand, belaboured the back and 
 head of the faulty slave all the way from the water 
 to the church door, accompanying every stioke 
 with suitable language. He enteied the church, 
 and we followed. He ascended the reading-desk, 
 and, with his face glowing with the exercise of his 
 supple jack, began the service with, u I said I 
 tvill take heed unto my ways that I sin not with 
 my tongue. I will keep my tongue as it were

 an animated discourse, of eleven minutes, upon 
 the practical duties of religion, from these words, 
 &quot; Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy; 5 
 and read the fourth commandment in the commun 
 ion. The whole congregation prayed fervently 
 that their hearts might be inclined to keep this 
 holy law. The blessing was pronounced ; and 
 parson and people hastened to the horse race. I 
 found the parson as much respected on the turf 
 as upon the hassock. He was one of the judges 
 of the race ; descanted, in the language of the

 turf, upon the points of the two rival horses ; and 
 the sleeve of his cassock was heavily laden with 
 the principal bets. The confidence of his par 
 ishioners was not ill founded ; for they assured 
 me, upon oath and honour, that he was a gen 
 tleman of as much uprightness as his grace the 
 archbishop of Canterbury. Ay, they would sport 
 him for a sermon or a song against any parson in 
 the union. 
 
 The whole of this extraordinary scene was nov 
 el to me. A certain staple of New England which 
 I had with me, called conscience, made my situ 
 ation, in even the passive part I bore in it, so auk- 
 ward and uneasy, that 1 could not refrain from 
 observing to my friend my surprise at the parson s 
 conduct, in chastising his servant immediately be 
 fore divine service. My friend was so happily 
 influenced by the habits of these liberal enlighten 
 ed people, that he could not even comprehend 
 the tendency of my remark. He supposed it lev 
 elled at the impropriety, not of the minister, but 
 the man ; not at the act, but the severity of the 
 chastisement ; and observed, with warmth, that 
 the parson served the villain right ; and that, if 
 he had been his slave, he would have killed the 
 black rascal, if he was sure he should have to pay 
 a hundred guineas to the public treasury for him. 
 I will note here, that the reader is requested, 
 whenever he meets with quotations of speeches 
 in the above scenes, excepting those during di 
 vine service, that he will please, that is, if his 
 habits of life will permit it, to interlard those quo 
 tations with about as many oaths as they contain

 monosyllables. He may rest assured that it will 
 render the scene abundantly more natural. It is 
 true, I might have inserted them myself and sup 
 ported it by illustrations and parodies from grave 
 authors ; but I never swear profanely myself, and 
 I think it almost as bad to oblige my readers to 
 purchase the imprecations of others. I give this 
 hint of the introduction of oaths, for the benefit 
 of my readers to the southward of Philadelphia ; 
 who, however they may enjoy a scene which re 
 flects such honour upon their country, when sea 
 soned with these palatable expletives, without 
 them, perhaps, would esteem it as tasteless and 
 vapid as a game of cards or billiards without bets , 
 or boiled veal or turkey without ham.

 men of established practice and eminence, fn 
 the interior country, the people could not distin 
 guish or encourage merit. The gains were small, 
 and tardily collected ; and in both wings of the 
 union, and I believe every where else, fortune and 
 fame are generally to be acquired, in the learned 
 professions, solely by a patient undeviating ap^ 
 plication to local business. 
 
 If dissipation could have afforded pleasure to a 
 mind yearning after professional fame and inde 
 pendence, I might, so long as my money lasted, 
 have been happy at the southward. I was often 
 invited to the turf; and might have had the hon 
 our of being intoxicated frequently with the most 
 respectable characters. An association with the 
 well educated of the other sex was not so readily 
 attained. There was a haughty reserve in the 
 manners of the young ladies. Every attempt at 
 familiarity in a young stranger, habituated to the 
 social but respectable intercourse customary in the 
 northern states, excited alarm. With my New 
 England ideas, I could not help viewing, in the 
 anxious efforts of their parents and relatives to 
 repel every approach to innocent and even chas 
 tened intercourse, a strong suspicion of that virtue 
 they were so solicitous to protect. 
 
 Depressed by the gloomy view of my prospects, 
 and determined never to face iny parents again 
 under circumstances which would be burthensome to 
 them, I attempted to obtain practice in the town 
 
 of F , in Virginia ; but in vain. The very 
 
 decorum, prudence, and economy, which would 
 have enhanced my character at home, were here

 construed into poverty of spirit. To obtain med 
 ical practice, it was expedient to sport, bet, drink? / 
 swear, &c. with my patients. My purse forbad 
 the former ; my habits of life the latter. My 
 cash wasted, and I was near suffering. I was ob 
 liged to dispose of my books for present subsist 
 ence ; and, in that country, books were not the 
 prime articles of commerce. To avoid starving, 
 I again contemplated keeping a school. In that 
 country, knowledge was viewed as a handicraft 
 trade. The school-masters, before the war, had 
 been usually collected from unfortunate European 
 youth, of some school learning, sold for their pas 
 sage into America : so that to purchase a school 
 master and a negro was almost synonymous. Mr. 
 
 j _ n? and some other citizens of the world who 
 
 had been cast among them, had, by their writings, 
 influence and example, brought the knowledge of 
 letters into some^repute since the revolution ; but 
 I believe those excellent men have yet to lament 
 the general inefficacy of their liberal efforts. This 
 statement, and my own prior experience in school- 
 keeping, would have determined me rather to 
 have preferred labouring with the slaves on their 
 plantations than sustaining the slavery and con 
 tempt of a school. 
 
 When reduced to my last dollar, and beginning 
 to suffer from the embarrassments of debt, I was 
 invited by a sea captain, who knew my friends, 
 to accept the birth of surgeon in his ship. Every 
 new pursuit has its flattering prospects. I was 
 encouraged by handsome wages, and a privilege 
 in the ship to carry an adventure, for the purchase

 of which the owners were to advance me on ac 
 count of my pay. I was to be companion to the 
 captain, and have a fine chance of seeing the 
 world. To quit my home for all parts of the 
 union I considered as home to tempt the peril 
 ous ocean, and encounter the severities of a sea 
 faring life, the diseases of torrid climes, and per 
 haps a total separation from my friends and pa 
 rents, was melancholy ; but the desire to see the 
 world, to acquire practical knowledge in my pro 
 fession, to obtain property, added to the necessity 
 of immediate subsistence, and the horrors of a 
 jail, determined me to accept his offer. I accor 
 dingly entered surgeon on board the ship Freedom, 
 captain Sidney Russell commander, freighted with 
 tobacco bound to London, and thence to the coast 
 of Africa. 1 had little to do in my passage to 
 London, my destination as a surgeon being prin 
 cipally in the voyage from that city to the African 
 coast, and thence to the West Indies ; and, if I 
 had not suffered from a previous nausea or sea 
 sickness, the novelty of the scene would have ren 
 dered me tolerably happy. In the perturbation 
 of my thoughts, I had omitted writing to my pa 
 rents of the places of my destination. This care 
 less omission afterwards caused them and me much 
 trouble. We arrived safelv in the Downs,

 like that fervid apostle, his bodily presence was 
 both mean and contemptible. When 1 saw him, 
 he was dressed in a snuff-coulored coat, olive 
 Velvet vest, drab breeches, coarse hose. His shoe-

 woe to courts and kings. If 1 should attempt to

 It is probable that this was the same identical wig 
 under the shadow of whose curls he wrote &quot; Com

 was a spare man, rather under size, subject to the

 sat reserved in company, and seldom mingled in

 in all cases to govern the majority. Peter smiled, 
 &quot; You must grant me,&quot; said 7n-common Sense* 
 &quot; that tne proportion of men of sense, to the igno 
 rant among mankind, is at least as twenty, thirty, 
 or even forty-nine, to a hundred. The majority 
 of mankind are consequently most prone to error ; 
 and, if we would achieve right, the minority ought * 
 in all cases to govern.&quot; Peter continued to smile 
 archly. &quot; If we look to experience,&quot; continued 
 Paine, &quot; for there are no conclusions 1 more prize 
 than those drawn, not from speculation, but plain 
 matter of fact, we shall find an examination into

 will not say but that your arguments are cogent, 
 though not entirely convincing. As it is a subject 
 rather out of my line, 1 will, for form sake, hold 
 the negative of your proposition, and leave it to 
 the good company which is right.&quot; &quot; Agreed ;&quot; 
 said Paine, who saw himself surrounded by his ad 
 mirers. &quot;Well, gentlemen,&quot; said Peter, with 
 all the gravity of a speaker of the house of com 
 mons, &quot; you that are of the opinion that the mi 
 nority, in all deliberative bodies, ought in all ca 
 ses to govern the majority, please to rise in the 
 affirmative.&quot; Paine immediately stood up him 
 self, and, as he had foreseen, we all rose in his 
 favour. &quot; Theni rise in the negative,&quot; cried Pe 
 ter. &quot; I am the wise minority, who ought in all 
 cases to govern your ignorant majority ; and, con 
 sequently, upon your own principles I carry the 
 vote. Let it be recorded.&quot; 
 
 This unexpected manoeuvre raised a hearty

 ted republican apostle, I never heard him express 
 the least doubt of, or cast the smallest reflection 
 upon, revealed religion. He spake of the glow ing 
 expressions of the Jewish prophets with fervour ; 
 and had quoted liberally from the Scriptures in 
 his &quot; Common Sense. &quot; How he came to write 
 that unreasonable little pamphlet called The Jlge 
 of Reason, 1 am at a loss to conjecture. &amp;lt;The pro 
 bable opinion attributes it to his passion for para 
 dox ; or that this small morsel of infidelity was 
 offered as a sacrifice to save his life from the de 
 vouring cruelty of Robespierre, that Moloch of the 
 French nation. It probably had its desired effect ; 
 for annihilating revealed religion could not but af 
 ford a diabolical pleasure to that ferocious wretch 
 and his inhuman associates, who could not expert

 a sanction for their cruelties while the least vestige 
 of any thing sacred remained among men. 
 
 When the reign of the terrorists ceased, an 
 apology was expected, and, even by the pious yet 
 catholic American, would have been received. To 
 the offended religion of his country no propitiatory 
 sacrifice was made. This missionary of vice pro 
 ceeded proselyting. He has added second parts, 
 and made other and audacious adjuncts to deism. 
 No might nor greatness escapes him. He has 
 vilified a great prophet, the saviour of the Gentiles; 
 he has railed at Washington, a saviour of his coun 
 try. A tasteful though irreligious scholar might 
 tolerate a chastised scepticism, if exhibited by 
 an acute Hume, or an eloquent Bolingbroke. But 
 one cannot repress the irritability of the fiery 
 Hotspur, when one beholds the pillars of morality 
 shaken by the rude shock of this modern Vandal. 
 The reader shouM learn that his paltry system is 
 only an outrage of wine ;* and that it is in the 
 ale-house he most vigorously assults the authority 
 of the prophets, and laughs most loudly at the 
 Gospel when in his cups.

 coat of Africa, thence to Barbadoes and to South- 
 Carolina with a cargo of slaves. 
 
 We were favoured with a clear sky and pleasant 
 gales ; after a short and agreeable voyage we touch 
 ed at Porto Santo, one of the Madeira Isles, where 
 we watered and supplied ourselves with fresh 
 provisions in abundance, to which the captain 
 added, at my request, a quantity of Madeira, 
 malmsey and tent wines, for the sick. We had a 
 fine run from the Madeiras to the Canary Isles. 
 The morning after we sailed I was highly gratified 
 with a full view of the island and peak of Ten- 
 eriffe ; which made its appearance the day before, 
 rising above the ocean, at one hundred miles dis- , 
 tance. We anchored off Fuertaventura, one of 
 the Canaries, in a good bottom. I went on shore 
 with the mate to procure green vegetables ; as 
 I ever esteemed them the best specific for that 
 dreadful sea disorder, the scurvy. Before we had 
 reached the Madeiras, though I had stored our 
 medicine chest with the best antiscorbutics, and 
 we had a plenty of dried vegetables on board, 
 yet the scurvy had begun to infect us. A plenti 
 ful distribution of green vegetables, after our arri 
 val at Porto Santo, soon expelled it from the crew. 
 At Fuertaventura I was delighted with the wild 
 notes of the Canary-bird, far surpassing the most 
 excellent of those I had seen in cages in the Uni 
 ted States. 
 
 I was anxious to visit the Cape de Verd Islands , 
 but, our course being too far east, we ran dowc 
 to the little island of Goree, to which the conten-

 tions of the English and French jcrowns have an* 
 nexed its only importance. The French officers 
 received us with politeness, arid were extremely 
 anxious for news from their pasent country. Soon 
 after we dropped anchor off Loango city, upon 
 a small well-peopled island near the coast of 
 Congo or Lower Guinea, in possession of the 
 Portuguese. Our captain carried his papers on 
 shore, and the next day weighed anchor and stood 
 in for the continent All hands were employed 
 to unlade the ship, aud the cargo was deposited 
 in a Portuguese factory,, at a place called Cacon- 
 go, near the mouth! ot the river Zaire. The day 
 after our arrival at Cacongo, several Portuguese 
 and negro merchants, hardly distinguishable how 
 ever by their manners, employments, or complex 
 ions, came to confer with the captain about the 
 purchase of our cargo of slaves. They contracted 
 deliver him two hundred and fifty head of slaves 
 eiert days time. To hear these men converse 
 upon the purchase of feuia.p beings, with the same 
 indifference,, and nearly in the- same language, as 
 if they were contracting for so many head of cattle 
 or swine, shocked, me exceedingly, But when 
 I suffered my imagination to rove to the habitation 
 of these victims to this infamous cruel commerce, 
 and fancied that I saw the peaceful husbandman 
 dragged from his native farm, the fond husband 
 torn from .the embraces of his beloved wife, the 
 jftotper frotn her babes, thejdnder child from the 
 auras of its parent, and all the tender endearing ties 
 oPftatursl and social affection rended by the hand

 I execrated myself for even the involuntary part 
 1 bore in this execrable traffic : I thought of my 
 native land, and blushed. When the captain kind 
 ly inquired of me how many slaves i thought 
 my privilege in the ship entitled me to transport for 
 my adventure, I rejected my privilege with horror, 
 and declared I would sooner suffer servitude than 
 purchase a slave. This observation was received 
 in the great cabin with repeated bursts of laughter, 
 and excited many a stroke of coarse ridicule. 
 Captain Russell observed, that he would not insist 
 upon my using my privilege if I had so much of 
 the yankee about me. Here is my clerk, Ned 
 Randolph, will jump at the chance, though the 
 rogue has been rather unlucky in the trade. Out 
 of five-and-twenty negroes he purchased, he nev 
 er carried but one alive to port, and that poor devil 
 was broken winded ; and he was obliged to sell 
 him for half price in Antigua. 
 
 Punctual to the day of the delivery, the con 
 tractors appeared, and brought with them about 
 one hundred and fifty negroes men, women, and 
 children. The men were fastened together in 
 pairs by a bar of iron, with a collar to receive 
 the neck at each extremity ; a long pole was pas 
 sed over their shoulder, and between each two was 
 bound by a staple and ring, through which the pole 
 was thrust, and thus twenty, and sometimes, thir 
 ty were connected together ; while their conductors 
 incessantly applied the scourge to those who loiter 
 ed, or sought to strangle themselves by lifting their 
 feet from the ground in despair ; which sometimes 
 had been successfully attempted. The women

 and children were bound with cords, and driven 
 forward by the whip. When they arrived at the 
 factory the men were unlosed from the poles, but 
 still chained in pairs, and turned into strong cells 
 built for the purpose. The dumb sorrow of some, 
 the phrensy of others, the sobbings and tears of 
 the children, and shrieks of the women, when they 
 were presented to our captain, so affected me, that 
 I was hastening from this scene of barbarity on 
 board the ship, when 1 was called by the mate, 
 and discovered, to my surprise and horror, 
 that, by my station in the ship, I had a principal 
 and active part of this inhuman transaction impos 
 ed upon me. As surgeon, it was my duty to in 
 spect the bodies of the slaves, to see, as the cap 
 tain expressed himself, that our owners were not 
 shammed off with unsound flesh. In this inspec 
 tion 1 was assisted by Randolph the olerk, ana two 
 stout sailors. It was transacted with all that un 
 feeling insolence which wanton barbarity can in 
 flict upon defenceless wretchedness. The man, 
 the affrighted child, the modest matron, and the 
 timid virgin, were alike exposed to this severe 
 scrutiny, equally insulting to humanity and com 
 mon decency. 
 
 I cannot even now reflect on this transaction 
 without shuddering. I have deplored my conduct 
 with tears of anguish ; and I pray a merciful God, 
 the common parent of the great family of the 
 universe, who hath made of one flesh and one 
 blood all nations of the earth, that the miseries, 
 the insults, and cruel woundings, I afterwards re-

 Treatment of the Slaves on board the Ship, 
 
 OF one hundred &amp;gt;and fifty Africans, we rejected 
 seventeen as not merchantable. While I was 
 doubting which to lament most those who were 
 about being precipated into all the miseries of an 
 American slavery, or those whom we had rejected 
 as too wretched for slaves captain Russell was 
 congratulating the slave-contractors upon the im 
 mense good luck they had in not suffering more 
 by this lot of human creatures. I understood that, 
 what from wounds received by some of these mis 
 erable creatures at their capture, or in their vio 
 lent struggles for liberty, or attempts at suicide, 
 and what with the fatigue of a long journey, partly 
 over the burning sands of a sultry climate, it was 
 usual to estimate the loss in the passage to the 
 sea-shore at twenty -five in a hundred.

 No sooner was the purchase completed, than 
 these wretched Africans were transported in herds 
 aboard the ship, and immediately precipitated 
 between decks, where a strong chain, attached to 
 a staple in the lower deck, was ri vetted to the 
 bar before described ; and then the men were 
 chained in pairs and hand-cuffed, and two sailors 
 wiiiitcuHasses guarded: eveky twenty ; while the 
 women 1 arid children were tied f together in pairs 
 wilb rope?;; a*)d 6T&amp;gt;l3geii to supply the men with 
 provisions and -the siifsli-bucket ; or, if the young 
 women were released, it was only to gratify the 
 brutal lust of the sailors : for though 1 cannot say 
 1 ever was witness to an actual rape, yet the fre 
 quent shrieks of these forlorn females in the births 
 of the seamen left me little charity to doubt of 
 the repeated commission of that degrading crime. 
 The eve after we had received the slaves on board, 
 all hands were piped on deck, and ordered to as 
 sist in manufacturing and knotting cat-o nine-tails, 
 the application of which, 1 was informed, was al 
 ways necessary to bring the slaves to their appe 
 tite. The night after they came on board was 
 spent by these wretched people in sobbings, groans, 
 tears, and the most heart-rending bursts of sorrow 
 and despair. The next morning all was still. Sur 
 prised by this unexpected silence, I almost ho 
 ped that providence, in pity to these her misera 
 ble children, had permitted some kindly suffoca 
 tion to put a period to their anguish. It was nei 
 ther novel nor unexpected to the ship s crew. It is 
 only the dumb fit come on, cried every one : we 
 will cure them. After breakfast, the whole ship s

 crew went between decks, and carried with them 
 the provisions for the slaves, which they one and 
 all refused to eat. A more affecting group of mis 
 ery was never seen. These injured Africans, pre 
 ferring death to slavery, or perhaps buoyed above 
 the fear of dissolution by their religion, which 
 taught them to look with an eye of faith to a coun 
 try beyond the grave, where they should again 
 meet those friends and relatives from whose en 
 dearments they had been torn, and where no fiend 
 should torment or Christian thirst for gold, had 
 resolved to starve themselves, and every eye 
 lowered the fixed resolve of this deadly intent. 
 In vain were the men beaten. They refused to 
 taste one mouthful ; and I believe, would have 
 died under the operation, if the ingenious cruel 
 ty of the clerk, Randolph had not suggested the 
 plan of whipping the women and children in sight 
 of the men ; assuring the men they should be tor 
 mented until all had eaten. What the torments 
 exercised on the bodies of these brave Airicans 
 failed to produce, the feelings of nature effected. 
 The negro, who could undauntedly expire under 
 the anguish of the lash, could not view the ago 
 nies of his wife, child, or mother , and though re 
 peatedly encouraged by these female sufferers to 
 persevere unto death, unmoved by their torments, 
 yet, though the man dared to die, the father re- 
 iented, and in a few hours they had all eaten their 
 provisions, mingled with their tears. 
 
 Our slave-dealers being unable to fulfil their 
 contract, unless we tarried three weeks longer, our 
 captain concluded to remove to some other market.

 We accordingly weighed anchor, steered for Benin, 
 and anchored in the river Formosa, where we 
 took in one hundred and fifteen more slaves. The 
 same process in the purchase was pursued here ; 
 and though I frequently assured the captain, as a 
 * physician, that it was impracticable to stow fifty 
 more persons between decks without endangering 
 health and life, yet the whole hundred and fifteen 
 were thrust, with the rest, between decks. The 
 stagnant confined air of this infernal hole, rendered 
 more deleterious by the stench of the faeces and 
 violent perspiration of such a crowd, occasioned 
 putrid diseases ; and, even while in the mouth ot 
 the Formosa, it was usual to throw one or two ne 
 gro corpses over every day. It was in vain that I 
 remonstrated to the captain. In vain I enforced the 
 necessity of more commodious births, and a more 
 free influx of air for the slaves. In vain I repre 
 sented that these miserable people had been used 
 to the vegetable diet and pure air of a country 
 life ; that at home they were remarkable for clean 
 liness of person, the very rites of their religion 
 consisting, almost entirely, in frequent ablutions. 
 The captain was by this time prejudiced against 
 me. He observed that he did not doubt my skill, 
 and would be bound by my advice, as to the health 
 of those on board his ship, when he found I was 
 actuated by the interest of the owners ; but he 
 feared that 1 was now moved by some yankee non 
 sense about humanity. 
 
 Randolph the clerk blamed me in plain terms. 
 He said he had made seven African voyages with 
 as good surgeons as I was ; and that it was their

 common practice, when an infectious disorder 
 prevailed, among the slaves, to make critical search 
 for all those who had the slightest symptoms of it, 
 or whose habits of body inclined them to it ; to 
 tie them up and cast them over the ship s side to 
 gether, and thus at one dash to purify the ship. 
 What signifies, added he, the lives of the black 
 devils ? They love to die. You cannot please them 
 better than by chucking them into the water. 
 
 When we stood out to sea, the rolling of the 
 vessel brought on the sea sickness, which encrea- 
 sed the filth : the weather being rough, we were 
 obliged to close some of the ports which ventila 
 ted the space between decks, and death raged 
 dreadfully among the slaves. Above two thirds 
 were diseased. It was affecting to observe the 
 ghastly smile on x the countenance of the dying Af 
 rican, as if rejoicing to escape the cruelty of his 
 oppressors. I noticed one man, who gathered all 
 his strength, and in one last effort spoke with 
 great emphasis, and expired. I understood by 
 the linguist, that with his dying breath he in 
 vited his wife and a boy and girl to follow 
 him quickly, and slake their thirst with him at 
 the cool streams of the fountain of their Great 
 Father, beyond the reach of the wild white beasts. 
 The captain was now alarmed for the success ot 
 his voyage ; and, upon my urging the necessity 
 of landing the slaves, he ordered the ship about, 
 and we anchored near an uninhabited part of the 
 Gold Coast I conjecture, not far from Cape St- 
 Paul.

 Tents were erected on the shore, and the 
 sick landed. Under my direction they recovered 
 surprisingly. It was affecting to see the effect 
 gentle usage had upon these hitherto sullen obsti 
 nate people. As I had the sole direction of the 
 hospital, they looked on me as the source of this 
 sudden transition from the filth and rigour of the 
 ship to the cleanliness and kindness of the shore. 
 Their gratitude was excessive. When they re 
 covered so far as to walk out, happy was he who 
 could, by picking a few berries, gathering the 
 wild fruits of the country, or doing any menial 
 services, manifest his affection for me. Our lin 
 guist has told me, he has olten heard them behind 
 the bushes praying to their God for my prosperity, 
 and asking him with earnestness, why he put my 
 good black soul into a white body. In twelve 
 days all the convalescents were returned to the 
 ship, qxcept live, who staid with me on shore^ 
 and were to b^ taken on board the next day.

 Fundia, I sat at the door of my tent, and per 
 ceived our ship, which lay at one mile s distance, 
 getting under way, apparently in great haste. 
 The jolly boat, about ten minutes before, had 
 made towards the shore ; but was recalled by a 
 musket-shot from the ship. Alarmed by this 
 unexpected manoeuvre, I ran to the top of a small 
 hill, at the back of the hospital, and plainly dis 
 covered a square-rigged vessel in the offing en 
 deavouring to lock our ship within the land ; but 
 a land breeze springing up from the north-cast, 
 which did not extend to the strange vessel, and 
 our ship putting out all her light sails, being well 
 provided with ring sail, scudding sails, water sails, 
 and driver, I could perceive she outsailed her. It 
 was soon so dark that I lost sight of both, and I 
 passed a night of extreme anxiety, which was in 
 creased by what I conjectured to be flashes of guns 
 in the south-west ; though at too great distance for 
 me to hear the report?. 
 
 The next morning no vessels were to be seen 
 on the coast, and the ensuing day was spent in 
 a state of dreadful suspense. Although I had 
 provisions enough with me for some weeks, and 
 was sheltered by our tents, yet to be separated 
 from my friends and country, perhaps for ever, and 
 to fall into the hands of the barbarous people which 
 infested this coast, was truly alarming. The five 
 Africans who were with me could not conceal their 
 joy at the departure of the ship. By signs they 
 manifested their affection towards me ; and when f 
 signified to them that the vessel was gone not to re,- 
 furn, they clapped their hands, and pointing inland.

 signified a desire to convey me to their native 
 country, where they were sure I should be happy. 
 By their consultation, I could see that they were 
 totally ignorant of the w#y. On the third day, 
 towards evening, to my great joy, I saw a sail 
 approaching the shore, at the prospect of which 
 rny African associates manifested every sign of 
 horror. I immediately concluded that no great 
 blame would arise from my not detaining five men 
 in the absence of the ship ; and I intimated to 
 them that they might conceal themselves in the 
 brush, and escape. Four quitted me ; but one, 
 who made me comprehend that he had a beloved 
 son among the slaves, refused to go, preferring 
 the company of his child, in slavery itself, to free 
 dom and the land of his nativity. I retired to 
 rest, pleased with the imagination of soon rejoin- 
 ing my friends, and proceeding to my native coun 
 try. On the morning of the fourth day, as I was 
 sleeping in my tent with the affectionate negro at 
 my feet, I was suddenly awakened by the blow 
 ing of conch-shells, and the sound of uncouth 
 voices. I arose to dress myself, when the tent was 
 overset, and I received a blow from the back of 
 a sabre, which levelled me to the earth. I was 
 immediately seized and bound by severel men of 
 sallow and fierce demeanour, in strange habits, 
 who spake a language I could not comprehend. 
 With the negro, tents, baggage, and provisions, 
 I was carred to the boat, which being loaded was 
 immediately pushed off from the shore, and rowed 
 towards a vessel, which 1 now for the first time

 which was in pursuit of the Sympathy. She was 
 rigged differently from any I had ever seen, hav 
 ing two masts, a large square main-sail, another of 
 equal size, seized by the middle of a main yard 
 to her fore-mast, and what the sailors call a shoul 
 der of mutton sail abaft ; which with top-sails and 
 two banks of oars, impelled her through the water 
 with amazing velocity : although, for the clumsi 
 ness of her rigging, an American seaman would 
 never have pronounced her a good sea-boat. At 
 her ma in- mast head was a broad black pennant, 
 with a crescent and a drawn sabre in white and 
 red emblazoned in the middle. The sides of the 
 vessel were manned as we approached ; and a 
 tackle being let down, the hook was attached to 
 the cord which bound me, and I was hoisted oa 
 board in the twinkling of an eye. Then, being 
 unbound, I was tarried upon the quarter-deck, 
 where a man, who appeared to be the captain, 
 glittering in silks, pearl, and gold, sat cross-legged 
 upon a velvet cushion to receive me. He was 
 nearly encircled by a band of men, with mon 
 strous tufts of hair on their upper lips, dressed in 
 habits of the same mode with their leader s, but 
 of coarser contexture, with drawn scimetars in 
 their hands ; and by his side a man of lighter 
 complexion, who, by the captain s command in 
 quired of me in good English if I was an English 
 man. I replied I was an American, a citizen of the 
 United States. This was no sooner interpreted to 
 the captain, than, at a disdainful nod of his head, 
 I was again seized, hand-cuffed, and thrust into 
 a r-irl v hole in the fore-castle, where I Jay twenty-

 four hours, without straw to sleep on, or any thing 
 to eat or drink. The treatment we gave the un 
 happy Africans on board the Sympathy now came 
 full into my mind ; and, what was more mortify 
 ing, I discovered that the negro who was captured 
 with me was at liberty, and fared as well as the 
 sailors on board the vessel. I had not however 
 been confined more than one half-hour, when the 
 interpreter came to examine me privately respect 
 ing the destination of the ship, to which he sus 
 pected I belonged ; was anxious to know if she 
 had her full cargo of slaves ; what was her force ; 
 whether she had English papers on board ; and if 
 she did not intend to stop at some other African 
 port. From him I learned that I was captured 
 by an Algerine rover, Hamed Hali Saad captain ; 
 and should be carried into slavery at Algiers. 
 After I had lain twenty-four hours in this loath 
 some place, covered with vermin, parched with 
 thirst, and fainting with hunger, 1 was startled at a 
 light through the hatchway, which opening softly, 
 a hand presented me a cloth, dripping with cold 
 water, in which a small quantity of boiled rice 
 was wrapped. The door closed again softly, and 
 I was left to enjoy my good fortune in the dark. 
 If Abraham had indeed sent Lazarus to the rich 
 man in torment, it appears to me he could not 
 have received a greater pleasure from the cool 
 water on his tongue than I experienced in suck 
 ing the moisture from this cloth. The next day, 
 the same kindly hand appeared again with the 
 same refreshment. I begged to see ray benefac-

 this people as the most blasphemous infidels. In 
 ten days after 1 was captured, the rover passed up 
 the Straits of Gibralter, and I heard the garrison

 WE saluted the castle with seven guns, which was

 ed to a heavy strong tower of the castle. The 
 Portuguese prisoners, to which nation the Alger- 
 ines have the most violent antipathy, were imn.e- 
 diately, with every mark of contempt, spurned 
 into a dark dungeon beneath the foundations of 
 the tower, though there were several merchants 
 of eminence and one young nobleman in the num 
 ber. The Spaniards, whom the Dey s subjects 
 detest as much and fear more, were confined with 
 me in a grated room on the second slory. We re 
 ceived the same evening rations similar to what 
 we understood w r ere issued to the garrison. The 
 next day we were all led to a cleansing house, 
 where we were cleared from vermin, our hair cut 
 short, and our beards close shaved ; thence taken 
 to a bath, and, after being well bathed, we were 
 clothed in coarse^ linen drawers, a straight waist 
 coat of the same without sleeves, and a kind of 
 tunic or loose coat over the whole, which with a 
 pair of leather slippers, and a blue cotton cop, 
 equipped us, as \ve were informed, to appear m . 
 the presence of the Dey, who was to select the 
 tenth prisoner from us in person. The next morn 
 ing the dragomen or interpreters were- very busy 
 in impressing upon us the most profound respect 
 for the Dey s person and power, and teaching us 
 the obeisance necessary to be made in our ap 
 proaches to this august potentate. Soon after we 
 were paraded, and captain Hamed presented each 
 of us with a paper, written in a base kind of Ara 
 bic, describing, as 1 was informed, our persons, 
 names, country, and conditions in life, so far as 
 our captors could collect from our several examin-

 ations. Upon the back of each paper was a mark 
 or number. The same mark was painted upon a 
 flat oval piece of wood, somewhat like a painter s 
 pallette, and suspended by a small brass chain, to 
 our necks, hanging upon our breasts. The guards 
 then formed a hollow square. We were blind 
 folded until we passed the fortifications, and then 
 suffered to view the city and the immense rabble 
 which surrounded us, until we came to the palace 
 of the Dey. Here, after much military parade, 
 the gates were thrown open, and we entered a 
 spacious court-yard, at the upper end pf which 
 the Dey was seated upon an eminence, covered 
 with the richest carpeting fringed with gold. A 
 circular canopy of Persian silk was raised over his 
 head, from which were suspended curtains of the 
 richest embroidery, drawn into festoons by silk 
 cords and tassels, enriched with pearls. Over the 
 eminence upon the right and left were canopies, 
 which almost vied in riches with the former, under 
 which stood the mufti, his numerous hadgis, and 
 his principal officers civil and military ; and on 
 each side about seven hundred foot-guards were 
 drawn up in the form of a half moon. 
 
 The present Dey, Vizier Hassen Bashaw, is 
 about forty years of age, five feet ten inches in 
 height, inclining to corpulency, with a counte 
 nance rather comely than commanding ; an eye 
 which betrays sagacity rather than inspires awe 
 the latter is sufficiently inspired by the fierce 
 appearance of his guards, the splendour of his at 
 tendants, the grandeur of his court, and the mag 
 nificence of his attire. He was arrayed in a

 sumptuous Turkish habit. His feet were shod 
 with buskins, bound upon his legs with diamond 
 buttons in loops of pearl ; round his waist was a 
 broad sash glittering with jewels, to which was 
 suspended a broad scymetar, the hilt of which 
 dazzled the eye with brilliants of the first water, 
 and the sheath of which was of the finest velvet, 
 studded with gems and the purest gold. In his 
 scarf were stuck a poignard and pair of pistols 
 of exquisite *workmanship. These pistols and 
 poignard were said to have been a present from 
 the late unfortunate Lewis the Sixteenth. The 
 former was of pure gold, and the value of the 
 work was said to exceed that of the precious metal 
 Jtwo hundred times. Upon the Dey s head was 
 a turban with the point erect, which is peculiar to 
 the royal family.N A large diamond crescent shone 
 conspicuously in the front, on the back of which 
 a socket received the quills of two large ostrich 
 feathers, which waved in graceful majesty over 
 his head. The prisoners were directed by turns 
 to approach the foot of the eminence. When 
 within thirty paces, we were made to throw our 
 selves upon the earth and creep towards the Dey, 
 licking the dust as a token of reverence and sub 
 mission. As each captive approached, he was 
 commanded to rise, pull off his slippers, and stand 
 with his face bowed to the ground, and his arms 
 crossed over his breast. The chieux or secretary 
 then took the paper he carried, and read the same. 
 To some the Dey put questions by his dragoman ; 
 others were dismissed by a slight nod of his head.

 officer came to where the prisoners were paraded, 
 and called for three by the number which was 
 marked on their breasts. The Dey s prerogative 
 gives him the right to select the tenth of all pris 
 oners ; and, as the service or ransom of them con 
 stitutes one part of his revenue, his policy is to 
 choose those whose friends or wealth would be 
 most likely to enrich his coffers. At this time he 
 selected two wealthy Portuguese merchants, and 
 a young nobleman of the same nation, called Don 
 Juan Combri. Immediately after this selection, 
 we were carried to a strong house or rather prison 
 in the city, and there guarded by an officer and 
 goiue of the crew of the Rover that had taken us. 
 The remainder of us being considered as private 
 property, another selection was made by the cap 
 tain and owners of the , Rover ; and all such as 
 could probably pay their ransom in a short time 
 were removed into a ^place of safety, and suffered 
 only a close confinement. The remnant of my 
 companions, being only eleven, consisted of the 
 negro slave, five Portuguese, two Spanish sailors, 
 an Italian fiddler, a Dutchman from the Cape of 
 Good Hope, and his Hottentot servant. As we 
 could proffer no probability of ransom, we were 
 reserved for another fate.

 The Slave Market. 
 
 ON the next market day we were stripped of the 
 dress in which we appeared at court. A napkin 
 was wrapped round our loins, and a coarse cloak 
 thrown over our shoulders. We were then ex 
 posed for sale in the market-place, which was a 
 spacious square, N inclosed by ranges of low shops, 
 in different sections of which were exposed the 
 various articles intended for sale. One section 
 was gay with flowers ; another exposed all the 
 fruits of the season grapes, dates, pomegranates, 
 and oranges, lay in tempting baskets ; a third was 
 devoted to sallads and pot herb? ; a fourth to milk 
 and cream. Between every section was a small 
 room, where those who come to market might oc 
 casionally refresh themselves with a pipe of tobac 
 co, a cud of opium, a glass of sherbet, or other 
 cooling liquors. Sherbet is composed of lemons, 
 oranges, sugar, and water it is what we in New 
 England call beverage. In the centre of the mar 
 ket an oblong square was railed in, where the deal 
 ers in beasts and slaves exposed their commodities

 for sale : here were camels, mules, asses, goats, 
 hares, dromedaries, women and men, and all other 
 creatures whether for appetite or use ; and I ob 
 served that the purchasers turned from one arti 
 cle to the other with equal indifference. The wo 
 men slaves were concealed in a latticed shop, but 
 the men were exposed in open view in a stall sit 
 uated between those appropriated to the asses and 
 to the kumrah, a wretched looking though service 
 able animal in that country, propagated by a jack 
 upon a cow. I now discovered the reason of the 
 alteration in our dress ; for, as the people here no 
 more than in New England love to buy a pig in 
 the poke, our loose coats were easily thrown open, 
 and the purchaser had an opportunity of exam 
 ining into the state of our bodies. It was aston 
 ishing to observe how critically they examined 
 my muscles, to see if 1 was naturally strong j 
 moved my lirnbs in various directions, to detect 
 any latent lameness or injury in the parts ; and 
 struck suddenly before my eyes, to judge by my 
 winking if I was clear sighted. Though I could 
 not understand their language, I doubt not they 
 spoke of my activity, strength, age, &c, in the 
 same manner as we at home talk in the swop of 
 a horse. One old man was very critical in his 
 examination of me. He made me walk, run, lie 
 down, and lift a weight of about sixty pounds. 
 He went out and soon returned with another man. 
 They conferred together, and the second was more 
 critical in his examination than the first. He ob 
 liged me to run a few rods, and then laid his 
 band suddenly to my heart, to see, as I conjecture.

 if my wind was good. By the old man I was 
 purchased. What the price given for me was I 
 cannot tell. An officer of the market attested the 
 contract, and I was obliged by the master of the 
 shop, who sold me upon commission for the benefit 
 of the persons concerned in the Rover, to lie down 
 in the street, take the foot of my new master, and 
 place it upon my neck making to him what the 
 lawyers call attornment. 1 was then seized by 
 two slaves, and led to the house of my new mas 
 ter, 
 
 Perhaps the free citizen of the United States 
 may, in the warmth of his patriotism, accuse me 
 of a tameness of spirit in submitting to such gross 
 disgrace. I will not justify myself. Perhaps I 
 ought to have asserted the dignity of our nation, 
 in despite of bastinadoes, chains, or even death 
 itself. Charles the Twelfth of Sweden has how 
 ever been stigmatised by the historian as a mad 
 man, for opposing the insulting Turk, when a pris 
 oner, though assisted by nearly two hundred brave 
 men. If any of my dear countrymen censure 
 my want of due spirit, 1 have only to wish hir 
 in my situation at Algiers, that he may avail him 
 self of a noble opportunity of suffering gloriously 
 lor his country.

 THE higher his rank in society, the further is man 
 removed from nature. Grandeur draws a circle 
 round the great, and often excludes from them the 
 finer feelings of the heart : the wretched are all 
 of one family, and ever regard each other as 
 brethren. Among the slaves of my new master 
 I was received with pity, and treated with ten 
 derness, bordering upon fraternal affection. They 
 could not indeed speak my language, and I was 
 ignorant of theirs ; but by dividing the scanty 
 meal, composing my couch of straw, and allevia 
 ting my more rugged labours, they spake that uni

 weakness, I will confess that some time after I 
 was captured I often suffered fancy to cheat me 
 of my &quot; weary moments,&quot; by pourtraying those 
 scenes which had often amused me in my closet, 
 and delighted me on the stage. Sometimes I even 
 contemplated with pleasure the company and con 
 verse of my fellow slaves. I expected to find 
 them men of rank at least, if not of learning. I 
 fancied my master s cook an English lord ; his 
 valet an Italian duke ; his groom a knight of Mal 
 ta ; and even his foot- boy some little lively 
 French marquis. I fancied my future master s 
 head gardener taking me one side, professing 
 the warmest friendship, and telling me in confi 
 dence that he was a Spanish Don with forty noble 
 names ; that he had fallen in love with my mas 
 ter s fair daughter, whose mother was a Christian 
 slave : that the young lady was equally charmed 
 &amp;gt;vith him ; that she was to rob her father of a 
 rich casket of jewels, there being no dishonour in 
 stealing from an infidel ; jump into his arms in 
 boy s clothes that very night, and escape by a ves 
 sel already provided to his native country. I saw 
 in imagination all this accomplished. I saw the 
 lady descend the rope-ladder ; heard the old man 
 nnd his servants pursue ; saw the lady carried off 
 breathless in the arms of her knight ; arrive safe 
 in Spain ; was present at the lady s baptism into 
 the catholic church, and at her marriage with her 
 noble deliverer. I was myself almost stifled with 
 the caresses of the noble family, for the part I 
 had borne in this perilous adventure ; and in fine 
 married to Donna somebody, the Don s beautiful

 sister ; returned into my own country loaded witL 
 beauty and riches ; and perhaps was aroused from 
 my reverie by a poor fellow slave, whose extreme 
 ignorance had almost blunted the sensibility of 
 bis own wretchedness. 
 
 Indeed, so sweet were the delusions of my own 
 fancy, I am loth to destroy the innocent gratifica 
 tion which the readers of novels and plays enjoy 
 from the works of a Behn and a Colman ; but the 
 sober character of a historian compels me to assure 
 my readers, that, whatever may have happened 
 in the sixteenth century, I never saw during my 
 captivity a man of any rank, family, or fortune, 
 among the. menial slaves, the Dey, as I have al 
 ready observed, selecting his tenth prisoner from 
 those who would most probably afford the richest 
 ransom : those concerned in the captures are in 
 fluenced by the same motive. All who may be 
 expected to be ransomed are deprived of their lib 
 erty it is true ; but fed, clothed, and never put to 
 manual labour, except as a punishment for some 
 actual crime, or attempting to recover their lib- 
 erty. The menial slaves are generally composed 
 of the dregs of those nations with whom they are 
 at war ; but, though my fellow slaves were gross 
 ly illiterate, I must do them the justice to say they 
 had learned well the kinder virtues : those virtues 
 which schools and colleges often fail to teach, 
 which, as Aristotle well observes, are like a flame 
 of fire light them up in whatever climate you

 THE name of my master was Abdel Melic. He 
 had been formerly an officer in the Dey s troops, 
 and it was saidx bad rendered the Dey s father 
 some important service in an insurrection, and was 
 therefore highly respected ; though at that time he 
 had no public employment. He was an austere 
 man ; his natural severity being probably increas 
 ed by his employment as a military officer. I ne 
 ver saw the face of any person in his family, 
 except the male slaves. The houses of the Alge- 
 rines are nearly all upon the same model, consis 
 ting of a building towards the street of one or two 
 stories, which is occupied by the master and male 
 domestics, and which is connected by a gallery 
 upon the ground, if the house be of one story ; 
 h of two, the entrance is above stairs to a building 
 of nearly the same size behind, which has no win- 
 or lattices at the side, but looks into a gar- 
 which fs always surrounded by a high wall,

 In these back apartments the women are iougf &amp;lt; ., 
 both wives and slaves. My master had a wife, 
 the daughterof a principle officer in the Dey s court, 
 and to my surprise had on y one. I found it tr 
 be a vulgar error that the Algerines had generally 
 more. It is true they are allowed four by their iaw ; 
 but they generally find, as in our country, one lady 
 sufficient for all the comforts of connubial life, and 
 never take another, except family alliance or bar 
 renness renders it eligible or necessary. The 
 more I became acquainted with their customs, the 
 more was I struck with their great resemblance to 
 the patriarchal manners described in Holy Writ. 
 Concubinage is allowed ; but few respectable peo 
 ple practise it, except for the sake of heirs. With 
 the Algerines the barrenness of RACHEL is some 
 times compensated to the husband by the fertility 
 of a BILHAH. After I had lived in this town- 
 house about three weeks, during which time I 
 \vas clothed after the fashion of the country, my 
 master moved with his whole family to a country- 
 house on the river Saffran. Our journey, which 
 was about twelve miles, was performed in the 
 evening : two carriages resembling our travelling 
 waggons contained the women only that the bo 
 dies of them were latticed, and furnished with cur 
 tains to cover them in the day time, which were 
 rolled up in the evening ; two slaves preceded 
 the carriages ; Abdel Melic followed on horseback, 
 and i accompanied a baggage-waggon in the rear. 
 When we arrived at the country-house, the garden 
 gates were thrown open, and the carriages with 
 the women entered. The men were introduced to

 v . iie front apartments. I found here several more 
 slaves, equally ignorant and equally attentive and 
 kind towards ine as those I had seen in the town. 
 The next day we were all set to work in digging 
 fcr the foundation of a new wall, which was to 
 enlarge our master s gardens. The weather was 
 ^itry. The soil below the surface was almost a 
 quicksand, I, unused to hard labour, found my 
 strength soon exhausted. My fellow slaves, com 
 passionating my distress, were anxious, by chan 
 ging places with me, to render my share of the la- 
 hour less toilsome. As we had our stint for the 
 whole party staked out to us every morning, it was 
 in Ihe power of my kind fellow labourers to fa 
 vour me much. Often would they request me by 
 signs to repose myself in the shade, while they 
 encouraged each s other to perform my share of the 
 task. After a while our master came to inspect 
 the work; and conceiving that it did not advance 
 as fast as he wished, he put an overseer over us, 
 who, finding me not so active as the rest, first 
 threatened and then struck me with his whip. This 
 was the first disgraceful blow I had ever received. 
 Judge you, my gallant freeborn fellow citizens, 
 you who rejoice daily in our federal strength and 
 independence, what were my sensations ! I threw 
 down my spade with disdain, and retired from my 
 work, lowering indignation upon my insulting op 
 pressor. Upon his lifting his whip to strike me 
 agnin, I flew at him, collared him, and threw him 
 on his back. Then setting my foot on his breast, 
 1 called upon my fellow slaves to assist me to bind 
 the wretch, and to make one glorious effort for o-:r

 freedom. But I called in vain. They could net 
 comprehend my language ; and if they could, 1 
 spoke to slaves, astonished at my presunition, ami 
 dreading the consequences for me and themselves, 
 After their first astonishment, they ran and took 
 me gently off from the overseer, and raised him 
 with the greatest respect. No sooner was he upon 
 his feet, than, mad with rage, he took up a mat- 
 toe, and with a violent blow upon my head level 
 led me to the ground, 1 lay senseless, and was 
 awakened from my stupor by the severe lashes of 
 his whip, with which the dastardly wretch continu 
 ed to beat me until his strength failed. 1 was then 
 left to the care of my fellow slaves, who could only 
 wash my wounds with their tears. Complaint was 
 immediately made to my master, and I was sent 
 to work in a stone quarry about two miles from 
 the house. At first 1 rejoiced in escaping the mal 
 ice of this merciless overseer, but soon found 1 had 
 made no advantageous exchange. I was surroun 
 ded by the most miserable objects. My fellow 
 labourers had been put to this place as a punish 
 ment for domestic crimes, or for their superiour 
 strength, and all were obliged to labour equally 
 hard. To break hard rocks with heavy mauls, to 
 transport large stones upon our backs up the crag 
 gy sides of the quarry, were our common labours ; 
 and to drink water, which would have been delici 
 ous if cold, and to eat black barley bread and on 
 ions, our daily fare ; while the few hours allotted 
 to rest upon our flinty beds were disturbed by the 
 tormenting insects, or on my part by the more tor 
 menting dreams of the dainties of my father ? hou.-r-.-

 .there is a spring under a rock upon my father s 
 farm which we called the cold spring, from which 
 we used to supply our family with water, and 
 prided ourselves in presenting it as a refreshing 
 beverage in summer to our visitors. How often, 
 after working beyond my strength on a sultry Af 
 rican day in that horrid quarry, have 1 dreamt of 
 dipping my cup in that cold spring, and fancied 
 the waters eluding my taste as I raised it to my 
 lips. Being presented with a tumbler filled from 
 this spring, after rny return, in a large circle of 
 friends, the agonies I had suffered came so forcibly 
 into my recollection, that I could not drink the 
 water, but had the weakness to melt into tears. 
 
 How naturally did the emaciated prodigal in the 
 Scripture think upon the bread in his fa-her s house. 
 Bountiful Father of the Universe, how are the 
 common blessings of thy providence despised ! 
 When I ate of the bread of my fataer s house, 
 and drank of his refreshing spring, no grateful re 
 turn was made to him or thee. It was amidst the 
 parched sands and flinty rocks of Africa that thou 
 taughtest me, that the bread was indeed pleasant, 
 and the water sweet. Let those of our fellow 
 citizens, who set at nought the rich ^blessings of 
 our federal union, go like me to a load of slave 
 ry, and they will then learn how to appreciate the 
 value of our free government.

 the more if they were remediless. When a man 
 is degraded to the most abject slavery, lost to his

 fcunger and severe labour, I was carried to the 
 infirmary for slaves, to breath my last, where I 
 was visited by a mollah, or Mahometan priest. 
 He pitied the misfortunes of a wretch who, he 
 said, had suffered a cruel existence in this life, 
 and had no rational hopes of exchanging it for a

 ced my burthen with pleasure. Indeed I pity* 
 you, said he. I sorrow for your distresses and 
 pity your prejudices. I pity you too, replied I, 
 the tears standing in my eyes. My body is in 
 slavery, but my mind is free. Your body is at 
 liberty, but your soul is in the most abject slavery. 
 in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity. 
 You have sold your God for filthy lucre ; and * wha: 
 shall it profit you if you gain the whole world and 
 lose your own soul ? or what shall a man give in 
 exchange for his soul ?&quot; I respect your prejudices, 
 said the stranger, because I have been subject to 
 them myself. I was born in Birmingham in Eng 
 land, and educated a rigid dissenter. No man is 
 more subject to prejudice than an Englishman, and 
 no sectary more obstinately attached to his tenets 
 than the dissenter. But 1 have conversed with 
 the mollah, and 1 am convinced of the errors of 
 my education. Converse with him likewise. If 
 he does not convince you, you may glory in the 
 Christian faith, as that faith will be then founded 
 on rational preference, and not merely on your ig 
 norance of any other religious system. Suggest 
 the least desire to converse with the mollah, and 
 an order from the mufti will come to your master. 
 You will be clothed and fed at the public expence ; 
 be lodged one month in the college of the priest ; 
 and not returned to your labours, until the priest 
 shall declare you incorrigible. He then left me. 
 The heat increased, and my strength wasted.

 Immediately upon my entering these sacred 
 walls I was carried to a warm bath, into which 
 i was immediately plunged ; while my attendants, 
 as if emulous to cleanse me from all the filth of 
 error, rubbed me so hard with their hands and flesh- 
 brushes, that I verily thought they would have 
 flayed me. While 1 was still in a state of re 
 laxation from the use of the warm bath, I was 
 suddenly plunged into a contiguous cold one. I 
 confess I apprehended dangerous consequences 
 from so sudden a check of such violent perspira* 
 tion ; but I arose from the cold bath highly invig 
 orated.* I was then anointed, in all the parts 
 of my body which had been exposed to the sun, 
 with a preparation of gum, called the balm of 
 Mecca. This application excited a very uneasy 
 sensation, similar to the stroke of the water-pepper 3

 When the profnsest perspiration was thus excited, 
 the patient was carried, and often, with Indian for 
 titude, ran, to the next stream, and plunged fre 
 quently through the ice into the coldest water. This 
 process, which Boerliaave and Sydenharil would 
 have pronounced deletery, ever produced pristine 
 health and vigour, when prescribed by the Indian 
 physician, or pew-wow.

 This balm the Algerine ladies procure at a great 
 expense, and use it as a cosmetic to heighten 
 their beauty. 
 
 After I had been clothed in the drawers, slip 
 pers, loose coat, and shirt of the country ? if shirt 
 it could be called, which neck had none ; my 
 hands and feet were tinged yellow, with a decoc 
 tion of the herb henna ; which colour, they said 
 denoted purity of intention. I was lodged and 
 fed well, and suffered to amuse myself and re 
 cover my health of body and mind. On the 
 eleventh day, as I was reclining on the margin of 
 a retired fountain, reflected on my dearnative coun 
 try, I was joined by the mollah. He was a man of 
 about thirty years of age, of the most pleasing 
 countenance and engaging deportment. He was* 
 born at Antioch, and educated a Christian of the 
 Greek church. He was designed by his parents 
 for a preferment in that church, when he was cap 
 tured by the Algerines, and almost immediately 
 conformed to the mussulman faith ; and was hi 
 high esteem in the sacred college of the priests, 
 As he spoke Latin and some modern languages 
 fluently, was well versed in the Bible and Chris 
 tian doctrines, he wit often employed in prosely 
 ting the European slaves, and prided himself ia 
 his frequent success. 
 
 He accosted me with the sweetest modulation 
 of voice ; kindly inquired after my welfare ; beg 
 ged to know if my lodging, dress, and fare, were 
 agreeable ; assuring me that if I wished to

 the fare and modes of my native country, and 
 would give my directions, they should be obeyed. 
 He requested me to appoint a time when we might 
 converse upon the great subject ot religion. He 
 observed that he wished me free from bodily indis 
 position, and that the powers of my mind would 
 recover their activity. He said the holy faith he 
 offered to my embraces disdained the use of other 
 powers than rational argument ; that he left to the 
 church of Rome and its merciless inquisitors all 
 the honour and profit of conversion by faggots, 
 dungeons, and racks. He made some further in 
 quiry as to my usage in the college, and retired. 
 1 had been so long accustomed to the insolence 
 of domestic tyranny ; so often groaned under the 
 whip and burthen ; so often been buffeted, spurned, 
 and spit upon, that I had steeled my mind against 
 the force and terror I anticipated from the mollah ; 
 but was totally unprepared for such apparent can 
 dour and gentleness. Though i viewed his conduct 
 as insidious, yet he no sooner retired, than, over 
 come by his suavity of manners, for the first 
 time ! trembled for my faith, and burst into tears.

 The Author confereth with a Mollah, or Mahome

 preserve the Freedom of his Mind. 
 
 UPON the margin of a refreshing fountain, shad 
 owed by the fragrant branches of the orange,

 I maintained the sacred truths of our holy religion 
 against the insidious attack of the mussulman priest. 
 To be more perspicuous, I have condensed our 
 conversation, and, to V! avoid useless repetition, 
 have assumed the manner of a dialogue. 
 
 Mollah. Born in New England, my friend, 
 you are a Christian purified by Calvin. Born in 
 the Campania of Rome, you had been a papist. 
 Nursed by the Hindoos, you would have entered 
 the pagoda with reverence, and worshipped the soul 
 of your ancestor in a duck. Educated on the bank of 
 the Wolga, the Delia Lama had been your god. In 
 China you would have worshipped Tien and per 
 fumed Confucius, as you bowed in adoration be 
 fore the tablets of your ancestors. Cradled with

 trembled with pious awe as you presented your 
 rice and your ghee to the adorable cock and dog. 
 
 A wise man adheres not to his religion because 
 it was that of his ancestors. He will examine the 
 creeds of other nations, compare them with his 
 own, and hold fast that which is right. 
 
 Author. You speak well. I will bring my re- - 
 ligion to the test. Compare it with the the 
 
 Mollah. Speak out boldly. No advantage 
 shall be taken. You would say with the Mahom 
 etan imposture. To determine which of two re 
 vealed religions is best, two inquiries are alone 
 necessary. First, which of them has the highest 
 proof of its divine origin ? and which inculcates 
 the purest morals ? that is, of which have we the 
 greatest certainty that it came from God ? and 
 which is calculated to do most good to mankind ? 
 
 Author. True. As to the first point, our Bi 
 ble was written by men divinely inspired. 
 
 Mollah. Our Alcoran was writen by the finger 
 of the Deity himself. But who told you your 
 Bible was written by men divinely inspired ? 
 
 Author. We have received it from our ances 
 tors ; and we have as good evidence for the truths 
 it contains, as we have in profane history for any 
 historical fact. 
 
 Mollah. And so have we for the Alcoran. Our 
 ,sacred and profane writers all prove the existence 
 of such a prophet as Mahomet, that he received 
 the sacred volume from the hand of Gabriel, and 
 the traditions of our ancestors confirm our faith-

 Author. We know that the Christian religion 
 is true, from its small beginnings and wonderful 
 increase. None but the Deity himself could have 
 enabled a few illiterate fishermen to spread a reli 
 gion over the world, and perpetuate it to posterity. 
 
 Mollah. Your argument 1 allow to be forcible, 
 but grant us also the use of it. Mahomet was an 
 illiterate camel-driver. Could he, who could not 
 read or write, have published a book, which for 
 its excellence has astonished the world ? Would 
 the learned of Medina and Mecca have become his 
 disciples ? Could Omer and Abubeker, his suc 
 cessors, men equally illiterate have become the ad 
 miration of the world ? If you argue from the 
 astonishing spread of your faith, .view our prophet, 
 born five hundred and sixty nine years, and dating 
 the promulgation df his doctrine six hundred and 
 twenty years, after the birth of your prophet. 
 See the extensive countries of Persia, Arabia, Syria 
 Egypt, all rejoicing in its benign influence. See 
 our holy failh pouring its divine rays of light into 
 Russia and Tartary. See it received by en 
 lightened Greece, raising its crescent through the 
 rast Turkish empire and the African states. See 
 Palestine and Jerusalem, the birth place of your 
 prophet, filled with the disciples of ours. See 
 Asia and Africa, and a great part of Europe, ac- 
 knowledgeing the unity of God, and the missior* 
 of his prophet. In a word, view the world. See 
 two Mahometans, men professing a religion, 
 which arose six hundred and twenty years after 
 yours, to one Christian, computing Christians of

 of the miraculous spread of religion its due

 My blood boiled to hear this infidel vaunt him 
 self thus triumphantly against my faith ; and, if 
 it had not been for a prudence which in hours of 
 zeal 1 have since had cause to lament, I should 
 have taken vengeance of him upon the spot. I 
 restrained my anger, and observed that our reli 
 gion is supported by miracles. 
 
 Mollah. So is ours ; which is the more re 
 markable, because our great prophet declared he 
 was not sent into the world to work miracles, but 
 to preach the unity of the first cause, the resurrec 
 tion of the dead, the bliss of paradise, and the 
 torments of the damned. Yet his whole life was 
 a miracle. He was no sooner born, than, with a 
 voice like the thundering of Hermon, he pronoun 
 ced the adorable creed to his mother and nurses : 
 / profess that there is only one God, and that I 
 am his apostle. He was circumcised from all 
 eternity : and besides, at the same hour, a voice 
 of four mighty angels was heard proclaiming from 
 the four corners of the holy house ; the first saying, 
 4 Proclaim the truth is risen, and all lies shall 
 return into hell ; the second uttering, Now is 
 born an apostle of your own nation, and the Om 
 nipotent is with him ; the words of the third 
 were, A book full of illustrious light is sent to 
 you from God ; and the fourth voice was heard 
 to say, O Mahomet, we have sent thee to be a 
 prophet, apostle, and guide to the world! 
 
 When the apostle of God was about three 
 years old, the blessed child retired into a cave at

 the foot of mount Uriel, where the archangel Ga 
 briel, covering his face with his wings, in awful 
 respect approached him, saying, Bismillahi Rrah- 
 mani Rrhahimi ; in the name of the one Almigh 
 ty, Compassionate, and Merciful, I am sent to 
 pluck from thy heart the root of evil ; for thy 
 prayers have shaken the pillars of eternal decree. 
 The infant prophet said, The will of thy Lord 
 and mine be done. The archangel then opened 
 his bosom with a lancet of adamant, and taking 
 out his heart, squeezed from it the black drop of 
 original sin ; and having restored the heart, sunk 
 gently into the bosom of the Houri. 
 
 Do you wish for more miracles ? Hear how the 
 prophet, in the dark night, passed the seven heav 
 ens upon the sacred mule ; of the mighty angel 
 he saw, of such astonishing magnitude that it was 
 twelve thousand days journey in the space be 
 tween his eye-brows ; of the years he spent in 
 perusing the book of destiny ; and how he return 
 ed so speedily, that the mattress was not cold, and 
 he recovered the pitcher at his bed-side, which 
 he had overset at his departure, so that not one 
 drop of water was lost. Contrast these with 
 those of your prophet. He then vented a volume 
 of reproach horrible to hear, and too blasphemous 
 to defile my paper. 
 
 Author. Our religion was disseminated in 
 peace ; yours was promulgated by the sword. 
 
 Mollah. My friend, you surely have not read 
 the writings of your own historians. The history 
 of the Christian church is a detail of bloody 
 nsassacre ; from the institution of the Christian

 thundering legion under Constantine the Great, 
 (o the expulsion of the Moors out of Spain by 
 the ferocious inquisition, or the dragooning of the 
 Hugonots from France under Louis the Great. 
 The Massulmans never yet forced a man to adopt 
 their faith. When Ahubeker the caliph took a 
 Christian city, he forebore to enter a principal 
 church, because he would be led to pray in any 
 temple dedicated to God ; ^nd wherever he pray 
 ed, the building would be established as a mosque 
 by the piety of the faithful. The companions 
 and successors of the apostle conquered cities and 
 kingdoms, like other nations. They gave civil 
 laws to the conquered, according to the laws of 
 nations ; but they never forced the conscience of 
 any man. It is true, they then, and we now, when 
 a slave pronounces the ineffable creed, immedi 
 ately knock off his fetters and receive him as a 
 brother ; because we read in the book of Zuni 
 that the souls of true believers are bound up in 
 one fragrant bundle of eternal love. We leave 
 it to the Chistians of the West Indies, and Chris 
 tians of your southern plantations, to baptise the 
 unfortunate African into your faith, and then use 
 your brother Christians as brutes of the desert. 
 
 Here I was so abashed for my country, I could 
 not answer him. 
 
 Jluthor. But you hold a sensual paradise. 
 
 Mdlah. So the doctors of your church tell 
 you ; but a sensual heaven is no more imputable 
 to us than to you. When the Most Holy conde 
 scends to reveal himself to man in human lan 
 guage, it nuj3t be in terms commensurate with our

 conception. The enjoyment of the houri, those 
 immortal virgins who will attend the beautified be 
 liever, (he splendid pavilious of the heavens, are 
 all but types and significations of holy joys too 
 sublime for man in flesh to conceive of. In your 
 Bible, I read, your prophet refers to the time when 
 he should drink new wine in his father s kingdom/ 
 Now would it be candid in me to hastily brand the 
 heaven of your prophet as sensual, and to repre 
 sent your faithful in bliss as a club of wine-bib 
 bers ? 
 
 Author. But you will allow the pre-eminence 
 of the morality of the sacred Scriptures. 
 
 Mollah. Your Scriptures contain many excel 
 lent rules of life. You are there taught to be 
 kindly affectionate one towards another ; but they 
 recommend the u$e of wine, and do not forbid 
 gaming. The Alcoran, by forbidding in express 
 terms the use of either, cuts from its follower the 
 two principal sources of disquiet and misery. 
 Read then this spotless book. There you will 
 learn to love those of our faith, and not hate those 
 of any other. You will learn the necessity of 
 being virtuous here, that you may be happy and 
 not miserable hereafter. You will learn resigna 
 tion to the will of the Holy One ; because you 
 will know that all the events of your life were, in 
 the embryo of time, forged on the anvils of Di 
 vine Wisdom. In a word, you will learn the uni 
 ty of God, which, notwithstanding the cavil of 
 your divines, your prophet, like ours, came into 
 the world to establish, and every msn of reason

 good a mussulman as to have rejoiced in my con 
 version, though it might affect his purse. I expe 
 rienced the extremest contumely and severity ; but 
 I was never branded as a heretic. I had by this 
 time acquired some knowledge of their language, 
 if language it could be called, which bade defiance 
 to moods and tenses, appearing to be the shreds- 
 and clippings of all the tongues, dead and living, 
 ever spoken since the creation. It is well known 
 on the sea-coasts of the Mediterranean by the 
 name of Lingua Franca. Probably it had its rise 
 in the aukward endeavours of the natives to con 
 verse with strangers from all parts of the world ; 
 aud the vulgar people, calling all foreigners Franks, 
 supplied its name. I the more readily acquired 
 this jargon, as it contained many Latin derivatives, 
 If 1 have conjectured the true principles upon 
 which the Lingua Franca was originally formed, 
 that principle is still applied through all stages of 
 its existence. Every person assumes a right to 
 introduce words and phrases from his vernacular 
 tongue, and with some alteration in accent they 
 are readily adopted.* 
 
 This medley of sounds is spoken by the vul 
 gar, but people of higher rank pride themselves

 composition of boiled barley, rice, and treacle, I cal- 
 Ifed for the hasty fiudding and molasses. The 
 phrase was immediately adopted ; and haschi fiudah 
 molaschi is now a synonima with the ancient name. 
 And I doubt not, if a dictionary of the Lingua 
 Franca shall ever be compiled, the name of the

 cuous place.

 the labour and hard fare seemed, if possible, to 
 be augmented. The ease and comfort with which 
 I lived for some weeks past had vitiated my 
 appetite, softened my hands, and relaxed my 
 whole frame, so that my coarse fare and rugged 
 labours seemed more insupportable. I nauseated 
 our homely food, and the skin peeled from my 
 hands and shoulders. I made what inquiries f 
 could as to the interior geography of the coun 
 try, and comforted myself with the hope of es 
 cape ; conceiving it, under my desperate cir 
 cumstances, possible to penetrate unobserved the 
 interior country by the eastern boundaries of the 
 kingdom of Morocco, and then pass on south 
 west until I met the river Sanaga, as cour 
 sing that to its mouth I knew would bring me 
 to some of the European settlements near Go- 
 ree of Cape Verd. Preparatory to my intended 
 escape I had procured an old goat s skin, to 
 make which into something like a knapsack I 
 deprived myself of many hours of necessary 
 sleep, and of many a scanty meal to fill it with 
 provisions. By the use of my Lingua Franca 
 and a little Arabic, I hoped to obtain the as 
 sistance of the slaves and lower orders of the 
 people through whom I might journey. The on 
 ly insurmountable difficulty hi my projects was 
 to elude the vigilance of our overseers. By a 
 kind of roll-call the slaves were numbered every 
 night and morning, and at meal times : but, very 
 fortunately, a probable opportunity of escaping 
 unnoticed soon offered. It was announced to the 
 slaves that in three days tinae there would be a

 day of rest, a holiday, when they would be al 
 lowed to recreate themselves in the fields. This 
 intelligence diffused general joy. I received it 
 with rapture. I doubled my diligence in my 
 preparations ; and, in the afternoon previous to 
 this fortunate day, I contrived to place my lit 
 tle stock of provisions under a rock at a small 
 distance from the quarry. At sunset we were 
 all admitted to bathe, and 1 retired to my re 
 pose with bright hopes of freedom in my heart, 
 which were succeeded by the most pleasing 
 dreams of my native land. That beneficent Be 
 ing who brightens the slumbers of the wretched 
 with rays of bliss can alone express my raptures, 
 when, in the visions of that night, I stepped 
 lightly over a father s threshold, was surrounded 
 by congratulating friends and faithful domestics, 
 was pressed by the embraces of a father, and with 
 holy joy lelt a mother s tears moisten my cheek. 
 Early in the dawn of the morning, I was awa 
 kened by the congratulations of my fellows, who 
 immediately collected in small groups, planning 
 out the intended amusements of the day. Scarce 
 had they portioned the little space allotted to ease 
 according to their various inclinations, when an ex 
 press order came from our master that we should 
 go, under immediate direction of our overseers, to 
 a plain, about five miles distance, to be present 
 at a public spectacle. This was a grievous dis 
 appointment to them, and more especially to me. 
 I buoyed up my spirits however with the hopes 
 that in the hurry and crowd 1 might find means to

 WE were soon paraded, and reached to the plain

 proclaimed by a public crier, was to be empaled 
 alive for attempting to escape from bondage. The 
 consciousness that I had been, one moment before, 
 meditating the same act for which this wretch was 
 to suffer so cruelly, added to my feelings for a fel 
 low creature, excited so strong a sympathy for the 
 devoted wretch, that 1 was near fainting. 
 
 I will not wound the sensibility of my human 
 fellow citizens by a minute detail of this fiend-hke 
 punishment. Suffice it to say, that, after they had 
 stripped the sufferer naked, except a cloth around 
 the loins, they inserted the iron pointed stake in 
 to the lower termination of the vertebrae, and thence 
 forced it up near his back bone until it appeared 
 between his shoulders, with devilish ingenuity con- 
 contriving to avoid the vital parts. The slake 
 was then raised into the air, and the suffering 
 wretch exposed to the view of the assembly, wn- 
 thincr in all the contortions of insupportable agony* 
 Hovv long he lived I cannot tell ; I never gave but 
 one look at him : one was enough to appal a 
 New-England heart. I laid my head on the rails 
 until we &quot;retired. It was now obvious it was de- 
 &amp;lt;=ie;ned by our master that this horrid spectacle 
 should operate upon us as a terrifying example. 
 It had its full effect on me. I thought no more 
 of attempting an escape; but, during our return 
 was miserably tormented lest my knapsack and 
 provisions should be found and adduced against me, 
 as ^vidence of my intent to desert. Happily for 
 me I recovered them the next day, and no suspi= 
 cions of my design were entertained,

 The Author feels that he is indeed a Slave. 
 
 I NOW found that 1 was indeed a slave. My body 
 had been enthralled, but the dignity of a free 
 mind remained ; and the same insulted pride, 
 which had impelled me to spurn the villain slave- 
 driver who first struck me a disgraceful blow, had 
 often excited a surly look of contempt upon my 
 master and the vile instruments of his oppression ; 
 but the terror of the late execution, with the un- 
 abating fatigue of my body, had so depressed my 
 fortitude, that I trembled at the look of the over 
 seer, and was meanly anxious to conciliate his fa 
 vour by attempting personal exertions beyond my 
 ability. The trite story of the insurgent army 
 of the slaves of ancient Rome being routed by the 
 mere menaces and whips of their masters, which 
 I had ever sceptically received, 1 now credited.

 it deeply engraven upon their memories, that when

 Depression of spirits consequent upon my blast

 exertion brought on an hemoptysis, or expectora

 Soon after, fainting under my burden, I was taken

 HERE I was lodged comfortably, and had all the

 practice. But it was immaterial to me ; I had 
 cast my last anxious thoughts upon my dear native 
 land, had blessed my affectionate parents, and was 
 resigned to die. 
 
 One day, as I was sunk upon my bed after a 
 violent fit of coughing, I was awakened from a 
 doze by a familiar voice which accosted me in 
 Latin. 1 opened my eyes, and saw at my side 
 the mollah who attempted to destroy my faith. 
 It immediately struck me that his purpose was to 
 tempt me to apostatize in my last moments. The 
 religion of my country was all 1 had left of the 
 many blessings I once enjoyed in common with 
 my fellow citizens. This rendered it doubly dear 
 to me. Not that I was insensible of the excel 
 lence and verity of my faith ; no. If I had 
 been exposed to severer agonies than I suffered, 
 and had been flattered with all the riches and hon 
 ours these infidels could bestow, I trust I should 
 never have foregone that faith, which assured me, 
 for the miseries I sustained in a cruel separation 
 from my parents, friends, and under intolerable 
 slavery, a rich compensation in that future world, 
 where I should rejoin my beloved friends, and 
 where sorrow, misery, or slavery, should never 
 come, I judged uncandidly of the priest. He 
 accosted me with the same gentleness as when at 
 the college, commiserated my deplorable situation, 
 and, upon my expressing an aversion to talk upon 
 religion, assured me that he disdained taking any 
 advantage of my weakness ; nor would attempt 
 to deprive me of the consolation of my faith ? 
 when he feared I had no time left to ground

 a better. He recommended me to the particular 
 care of the religious, who attended the sick in the 
 hospital ; and having learned in our former con 
 ferences that I was educated a physician, he in 
 fluenced his friend the director of the infirmary 
 to purchase me, if I regained my health, and told 
 him I should be serviceable as a minor assistant. 
 If any man could have effected a change of 
 my religion, it was this priest. I was charmed 
 with the man, though I abominated his faith. His 
 very smile exhilarated my spirits and infused 
 health ; and, when he repeated his visits, and 
 communicated his plans of alleviating my distres 
 ses, the very idea of being freed from the oppres 
 sions of Abdel Melic made an exchange of slavery 
 appear desirable. I was again attached to life, 
 and requested him to procure a small quantity of 
 the quinquina, or Jesuit s bark. This excellent 
 : ciiic was unknown in the infirmary ; but as 
 \lgerines are all fatalists, it is immaterial to 
 the patient who is his physician and what he pre 
 scribes. By his kindness the bark was procured, 
 and I made a decoction, as near to Huxham s as 
 the ingredients I could procure would admit, which 
 1 infused in wine ; no brandy being allowed even 
 lor the sick. In a few weeks the diagnostics were 
 favourable, and I recovered my pristine health ; 
 and soon after the director of the hospital purchas

 to the care of the medicine room, with permission 
 to go into the city for fresh supplier

 ARGUMENT. 
 
 The Author s Practice as a Surgeon and Physician 
 in the City of Algiers. 
 
 MY circumstances were now so greatly ameliora 
 ted, that if I could have been assured of returning 
 to my native country in a few years, I should have 
 esteemed them eligible. To observe the customs, 
 habits, and manners, of a people of whom so 
 much is said and so little known at home, and 
 especially to notice the medical practice of a na 
 tion whose ancestors have been spoken of with 
 respect in the annals of the healing art, was high 
 ly interesting. 
 
 After a marked and assiduous attention of some 
 months to the duties of my office, I acquired the 
 confidence of my superiors so far, that I was some 
 times sent abroad in the city to examine a patient, 
 who had applied for admission into the infirmary ; 
 and sometimes the physicians themselves would 
 condescend to consult me. Though they affected 
 to despise my skill, I had often the gratification 
 of observing that they administered my prescrip 
 tions with success.

 In surgery they were arrant bunglers. Indeed, 
 their pretensions to knowledge in this branch were 
 so small, that iny superior adroitness scarcely oc 
 casioned envy. Applications, vulgarly common 
 in the United States, were there viewed with ad 
 miration. The actual cautery was their only 
 method of staunching an external haemorrhage. 
 The first amputation I operated drew all the prin 
 cipal physicians around me. Nothing could equal 
 their surprise at the application of the spring tour 
 niquet, which I had assisted a workman to make 
 for the occasion, except the taking up of the arte 
 ries. My friend the mollah came to congratulate 
 me on my success, and spread my reputation 
 wherever he visited. A poor creature was brought 
 to the hospital with a depressed fracture upon the 
 os frontis, sunk into a lethargy, and died. I pro 
 posed trepanning, but found those useful instru 
 ments unknown in this country. By the care of 
 the director, I had a set made under my direction ; 
 but, after having performed upon a dead, I never 
 could persuade the Algerine faculty to permit me 
 to operate upon a living, subject. What was 
 more amusing, they pretended to improve the aid 
 of philosophy against me, and talked of the weight 
 of a column of air pressing upon the dura mater, 
 which, they said, would cause instant death. Of 
 all follies, the foppery of learning is the most in 
 supportable. Professional ignorance and obstina 
 cy were not all I had to contend with ; religious 
 prejudice was a constant impediment to my sue* 
 cess. The bigotry of the Mahometan differs es- 
 .sentially from that of the Roman-catholic. The

 former is a passive, the latter an active, principle,. 
 The papist will burn infidels and heretics ; theMus- 
 sulman never torments the unbeliever, but is more 
 tenaciously attached to his own creed, makes his 
 faith- a principle in life, and never suffers doubt to 
 disturb or reason to overthrow it. I verily believe 
 that if the Alcoran had declared that the earth was 
 an immense plain and stood still, while the sun 
 performed its revolution round it, a whole host of 
 Gallileos, with a Newton at their head, could not 
 have shaken their opinion, though aided by all the 
 demonstrative powers of experimental philosophy, 
 I was invited by one of the faculty to inspect 
 the eyes of a child which had lost its sight about 
 three years ; I proposed couching, and operated 
 on the right eye with success. This child was 
 the only son of an opulent Algerine, who, being 
 informed that an infidel had restored his son to 
 sight, refused to let me operate on the other, pro 
 testing that if he had known that the operator was 
 an unbeliever, his son should have remained blind 
 until he opened his eyes upon the houri of para 
 dise. He sent me however a present of money, 
 and offered to make my fortune if I would abjure 
 the Christian faith and embrace Ismaelism, which, 
 he said, he believed I should one day do : as he 
 thought that God never would have decreed that I 
 should restore his son to sight, if he had not also 
 decreed that 1 should be a true believer.

 Visits a sick Lady. 
 
 MY reputation increased, and I was called the 
 learned slave ; and soon after sent for to visit a 
 sick lady. This was very agreeable to me ; for, 
 during my whole captivity, I had never yet seen 
 the face of a woman ; even the female children 
 being carefully concealed, at least from the sight 
 of the vulgar. I now anticipated much satisfac 
 tion from this visit, and hoped that through the 
 confidence with which a tender and successful 
 physician seldom fails to inspire his patient, I 
 should be able to acquire much useful information 
 upon subjects of domestic concern, impervious 
 to travellers. Prepararory to this visit I had 
 received a new and better suit of clothes than I 
 had worn, as a present from the father of the

 voting lady. A gilt waggon came to the gate 
 of the hospital, which I entered with our princi 
 pal physician, and was drawn by mules to a 
 country-house about five miles from the city, vyhere 
 I was received by Hadgi Mulladin, the father of 
 my patient, with great civility : real gentlemen 
 are the same in all countries. He treated us 
 with fruit and sherbet ; and smiling upon me 
 after he had presented a bowl of sherbet to the 
 principal physician, he handed me another bowl, 
 which, to my surprise, 1 found filled with an 
 excellent Greek wine, and archly inquired of mo 
 how I liked the sherbet* Hadgi Mulladin had 
 travelled in his youth, and was supposed to have 
 imbibed the libertine principles of the Chris 
 tian as it respected wine. This was the only 
 instance which came to rny knowledge of any 
 professed Mussulman indulging himself with wine 
 or any strong liquor ; and it was not unnoticed 
 by the principal physician, who afterwards grave 
 ly told me that Hadgi Mulladin would be undoubt 
 edly damned for drinking wine ; would be con 
 demned to perpetual thirst in the next world, 
 while the black spirit would present him with red 
 hot cups of scalding wine. Exhilarated by the 
 wine and the comparatively free manners of this 
 Algerine, 1 was anxious to see my patient. I 
 was soon gratified. Being introdced into a large 
 room, I was left alone nigh an hour. A side door 
 was then opened, and two eunuchs came forward 
 with much solemnity and made signs for me to 
 retire to the farthest part of the room, as if I had 
 been infested with some malignant disorder ~

 They were, in about ten minutes, followed by 
 four more persons of the same description, bear 
 ing a species of couch close covered with double 
 curtains of silk, which they set down in the midst 
 of the room ; and every one drew a broad scyme- 
 tar from his belt, flourished it in the air, inclined 
 it over his shoulder, and stood guard at every cor 
 ner of the couch. While I was wondering at this 
 parade, the two first eunuchs retired and soon re 
 turned ; the one bearing an ewer or bason of wa 
 ter, the other a low marble stand and some nap 
 kins in a China dish. I was then directe d to 
 wash my feet ; and another bason being produced, 
 it was signified that I must wash my hands, which 
 I did three times. A large thick muslin veil was 
 then thrown over my head, I was led towards the 
 couch, and was presented with a pulse glass, 
 being a long glass tube graduated and ter 
 minated below with a hollow bulb, and filled 
 with some liquid, which rose and fell like spir 
 its in the thermometer. This instrument was 
 inserted through the curtains, and the bulb applied 
 to the pulse of my patient, and the other extrem 
 ity put under iny veil. By this I was to form 
 my opinion of her disorder and prescribe a re 
 medy ; for I was not allowed to ask any questions, 
 or even to speak to, much more see, the lady, 
 who was soon re-conveyed to her apartment. The 
 two first eunuchs now marched in the rear, and 
 closed and fastened the doors carefully after them. 
 After waiting alone two hours or more, I was 
 called to give my advice ; and never was I more 
 puzzled. To confess ignorance would have ruin~_

 ed my reputation, and reputation was then life 
 itself. The temptations to quackery were power 
 ful, and overcame me. I boldly pronounced her 
 disease to be an intermittent fever, prescribed 
 venesection, and exhibited some common febri 
 fuge, with directions to throw in the bark when 
 the fever ceased. My prescriptions were atten 
 ded with admirable success ; and, if I had con 
 formed to their faith, beyond a doubt I might 
 have acquired immense riches. But I was a 
 slave, and all my gains were the property of 
 my master. 1 must do him the justice to say 
 that he permitted me to keep any particular pres 
 ents that were made to me. Frequent applications 
 were made to the director for my advice and as 
 sistance to the diseased ; and though he received 
 generally my fee, yet it was sufficiently gratifying 
 to me to be pesmitted to walk abroad, to amuse 
 myself, and obtain, information of this extraordin 
 ary people, as much of which as the prescribed 
 limits of this little work will admit I shall now lay

 The history of nations, like the biography of 
 man, assumes an interesting importance only when 
 Us subject is matured into vigour. To trace the 
 infancy of the old world, we run into childish 
 prattle and boyish tales. Suffice it then to say, 
 that the mixed multitudes which inhabited[this coun 
 try were reduced to the subjection of the Greek 
 emperors by the arms of the celebrated Belisarius, 
 and so continued until the close of the seventh 
 century, when they were subdued by the invinci 
 ble power, and converted to the creed of the an 
 cient caliphs, the immediate successors of the pro 
 phet Mahomet, who parcelled the country into 
 many subordinate governments. One of these 
 states is Algiers ; which is bounded on the north 
 by the Mediterranean ; on the south by mount 
 Atlas so familiar to the classic reader and the 
 chain of hills which extends thence to the north 
 east ; on (he west by the kingdom of Morocco*; 
 and on the east by the state of Tunis. The state 
 of Algiers is about five hundred miles in length 
 
 the term burbaros, a barbarian, which they indis

 It was nine hundred years after its conquest bv 
 the caliphs, and at the beginning of the tenth cen 
 tury, that the Algerines, by becoming formidable 
 to the Europeans, acquired the notice of the en- 
 lightened historian. About this time, two enter 
 prising young men, sons of a potter of the island 
 of 3Iytelene, the ancient Lesbos, called Horric 
 and Hayraddin, collecting a number of despera 
 does, seized upon a brigantine and commenced 
 pirates, making indiscriminate depredations upon 
 the vessels of all nations. They soon augmented 
 their force to a fleet of twelve galleys, besides 
 small craft, with which they infested the sea-coast 
 of Spain and Italy, and carried their booty into 
 the ports 6f Barbary, styling themselves the 
 lords of the sea, and the enemies of all those who 
 sailed upon it. European nations were not then 
 possessed of such established and formidable na 
 vies as at the present day : even the English, 
 who seem formed for the command of the sea, had 
 but few ships of force. Henry the Eighth built 
 some vessels, which, from their unmanageable bulk, 
 were rather suited for home defence than foreign 
 enterprize ; and the fleet of Elizabeth, which, in 
 1588, destroyed the Spanish armada, was princi 
 pally formed of ships chartered by the merchant-, 
 who were the general resource of all the maritime

 powers. The fleet of these adventurers was there 
 fore formidable ; and, as Robertson says, soon be 
 came terrible from the Straits of the Dardanelles 
 *o those of Gibraltar. The prospects of ambition 
 increase as man ascends its summit. Horric, 
 the elder brother, surnamed Barbarossa,, as some 
 assert, from the red colour of his beard, aspired 
 to the attainment of sovereign power upon land ; 
 and a favourable opportunity soon offered of grati 
 fying his pride. His frequent intercourse with 
 ;be Barbary states induced an acquaintance with 
 Kutimi, then king of Algiers, who was at war 
 with Spain, and had made several unsuccessful at- 
 Jacks upon a small fort built by that nation on the 
 Oran, in his distress, this king inconsiderately ap 
 plied to Barbarossa for assistance, who readily 
 embraced the invitation, and conducted himself 
 like more modern allies. He first assisted this 
 tveak king against his enemy, and then sacrificed 
 Jiim to his own ambition ; for, leaving his brother 
 liayraddin to command the fleet, he entered the 
 city of Algiers at the head of five thousand men, 
 was received by the inhabitants as their deliverer, 
 assisted them against the Spaniards, and then ar 
 rested and disarmed the principle people, secretly 
 murdered the unsuspecting Eutimi, and caused 
 himself to be proclaimed king of Algiers. Lavish 
 oi his treasures to his adherants, and cruelly vin 
 dictive to those he distrusted, he not only estab 
 lished his government, but dethroned the neighbour 
 ing king of Temecien, and annexed his dominions 
 io his own. But the brave marquis de Comere?,

 the emperor Charles the Fifth, assisted the dethro 
 ned king ; and, after defeating Barbarossa in sev 
 eral bloody battles, besieged him in Tamecien, 
 the capitol of that kingdom, where this ferocious 
 adventurer was slain in attempting his escape, but 
 fought his pursuers with a brutal rage becoming 
 the ferocity of his life. Upon the death of Bar- 
 barossa, his brother Hayraddin assumed the same 
 name and the kingdom of Algiers. This Barba- 
 rossa, is better known to the European annalist 
 for rendering his dominions tributary to the grand 
 seignior* He enlarged his power with a body of the 
 Turkish soldiers ; and, being promoted to the 
 command of the Turkish fleet, he spread the fame 
 of the Ottoman power through all Europe : for, 
 though obliged by the superior power of the em 
 peror Charles the Fifth to relinquish his conquest 
 of Tunis, which he had effected by a similar 
 treachery with which his brother had posessed 
 himself of Algiers, yet his being the acknowledg 
 ed rival of Andrew Doria, the first sea command 
 er of his age, has laurelled his brow among those 
 who esteem glory to consist in carnage. This 
 Barbarossa built a mole for the protection of the 
 harbour of Algiers, in which, it is said, he em 
 ployed thirty thousand Christian slaves :. he died 
 a natural death, and was succeeded by Hassan 
 Aga, a renegado from Sirdinia, elected by the sol- 
 dies, but confirmed by the grand seignior ; who, 
 taking advantage of a violent storm which wreck 
 ed the navy of the emperor Charles the Fifth, wh&amp;lt; 
 had invaded his territories, drove that proud em-&quot; 
 peror from the coast, defeated the rr^r of \\\.* ?.r

 i.uy, and captured so many of his soldiers, that the 
 Algerines, it is reported, sold many of their pris 
 oners, by way of contempt, at the price of an on 
 ion per head. Another Hassan, son to the se 
 cond Barbarossa, succeeded, and defeated the 
 Spaniards, who invaded his dominions under the 
 command of the count de Alcandara, killed that 
 nobleman, and took about twelve thousand prison 
 ers. But his successor Mahomet merited most the 
 thanks of his conntry, when, by ingratiating him 
 self with the Turkish soldiers, and by incorpora 
 ting them with his own troops, he annihilated the 
 contests of these fierce rivals, formed a permanent 
 body of brave disciplined troops, and enabled his 
 successor to renounce that dependence upon the 
 grand seignior, to which the second Barbarossa, 
 fcad submitted. 
 
 In 1609, the^Algerines received a vast accession 
 of strength and numbers from the emigrant Moors, 
 \vhom the weak policy of Spain had driven to 
 their dominions. Embittered by Christian severi 
 ty, the Moors flocked on board the Algerine vessels, 
 and sought a desperate revenge upon all who bore 
 the Christian name. Their fleet was said to con 
 sist at this period of upwards of forty ships, from 
 two to four hundred tons burthen. Though the 
 French, with that gallantry which distinguished 
 them under their monarchs, undertook to avenge 
 the cause of Europe and Christianity ; and, in

 sed his fleet ; yet this bold people were so elated

 ships of those powers with which he was in alli

 Scandaroon in Syria, an Ottoman city, they, in 
 1623, threw off their dependence on the Sublime 
 Porte. In 1637, the Algerine rovers entered 
 the British channel, and made so many captures 
 that it was conjectured near five thousand English 
 were made prisoners by them ; and, in the same 
 year, they dispatched Hali Pinchinin with sixteen 
 galleys to rob the rich chapel of Our Lady of 
 Loretto ; which proving unsuccessful, they ravaged 
 the scores of the Adriatic, and so enraged the Ven 
 etians, that they fitted out a fleet of twenty-eight 
 sail under the command of admiral Cappello, who, 
 by a late treaty with the Porte, had liberty to en 
 ter any of its harbours to destroy the Algerine gal 
 leys. Cappello was ordered by the Venetians to 
 sink, burn, and destroy, without . mercy, all the 
 corsairs of the enemy, and he bravely and sus- 
 cessfully executed his commisson. He immediate 
 ly overtook and defeated Pinchinin, disabled five 
 of his galleys ; and this Algerine retreating to 
 Valona and landing his booty, where he erected 
 batteries for its defence, the brave Cappello man 
 ned his boats and small craft, and captured his 
 wjiole fleet. In these actions about twelve hun 
 dred Algerines were slain ; and what was more* 
 pleasing, sixteen hundred Christian gaily-slave:^ 
 set at liberty. History affords no instance of a 
 people so repeatedly and suddenly recovering tht&amp;gt;5r

 Josses as the Algerines. Within a few years we 
 &nd them fitting out seventy sail of armed vessels, 
 and making such daring and desperate attacks up 
 on the commerce of nations, that the most haughty 
 maritime powers of Europe were more anxious to 
 shelter themselves under a treaty, and pay an hu 
 miliating tribute, than to attempt nobly to reduce 
 them to reason and humanity. But, after many 
 ineffectual attempts bad deen made to uniler the 
 force of Europe against them, the gallant French 
 by the command of Lewis the Fourteenth, again 
 roused themselves to chastise this intractable race. 
 In 1682, the marquis du Quesne with a large fleet 
 and several bomb-ketches, reached Algiers ; and 
 with sea-mortars bombarded it so violently, that 
 he laid almost the whole city in ruins. Whether 
 his orders went no further, or the vice-admiral 
 judged he had chastised them sufficiently, or wheth 
 er a violent storm drove his fleet from its moorings, 
 does not appear. But it is certain that he left the 
 c\iy abruptly, and the Algerines-, to revenge this 
 insult, immediately sent their fleet to the coast ot 
 France, and took signal reparation. 
 
 The next year du Quesne cast anchor before Al 
 giers with a large fleet ; and for forty-eight hours 
 made such deadly discharges with his cannon, and 
 showered so many bombs over this devoted city, 
 that the dey sued for peace. 
 
 The French admiral, with that generosity which 
 is peculiar to his nation, insisted, as an indispen 
 sable preliminary, that all the Christian slaves 
 should be sent on board his squadron, with Mez- 
 emorto, the dey s admiral, as a hostage for the

 performance of this preliminary article. The dej 
 assembled his divan, or council of great officers, 
 and communicated the French demands. Mez* 
 emorto immediately collected the sailors who had 
 manned the ramparts, and with whom he was a 
 favourite ; and, accusing the dey of cowardice, he 
 so inflamed them, that, being joined by the sol 
 diers, they murdered the dey, and elected Mez- 
 emorto in his stead. This was a signal for re 
 newed hostility, and never was there a scene of 
 greater carnage. The French seemed to have 
 reserved their fire for this moment, when thej 
 poured such incessant volleys of red-hot shot, bombs, 
 and carcasses, into the city, that it was nearly all 
 in flames. The streets run blood, while the 
 politic and furious Mezemorto, dreading a change 
 in the public mind, and conscious that another 
 cessation of arms would be attended with his 
 death or delivery to the French, ran furiously 
 round the ramparts, and exhorted the military to 
 their duty, and to make his new subjects despe 
 rate caused all the French slaves to be murdered ; 
 and seizing the French consul, who had been 
 a prisoner among them since the first declaration 
 of war, he ordered him to be tied hand and foot,

 the air towards the French fleet. The French were 
 s.o highly enraged that the sailors could scarcely 
 be prevented from attempting to land and des 
 troy this barbarous race. The vice-admiral con 
 tented himself with levelling their fortifications, 
 reducing the city to rubbish, and burning their

 preveriting the Algerines from again molesting 
 commerce. If the European maritime powers 
 had by treaty engaged themselves to destroy the 
 first armed galley of the Algerines which appear 
 ed upon the seas, and conjointly forbidden them 
 to repair their fortifications, this people might ere 
 now have from necessity turned their attention to 
 commerce ; the miscreants and outcasts of other 
 nations would have no longer found refuge among 
 them ; and the state at this time might have been 
 as celebrated for the peaceful arts as they are. odi 
 ous for the constant violation of the laws of nations 
 and humanity. This was surely the common inter 
 est of the European powers ; but to talk of their 
 common interest is idle. The narrow politics of 
 Europe seek an individual not a common good ; for 
 no sooner had France humbled the Algerines than 
 England thought it more for her interest to enter 
 into a treaty with the new dey, and, by way oi 
 douceur, sent to Algiers a ship load of naval and 
 military stores, to help them to rebuild their navy 
 and strengthen their fortresses ; while France, 
 jealous lest the affections of the monster Mezemor 
 to, who barbarously murdered their fellow-citizens, 
 should be attached to her rivals the English, im 
 mediately patched up a peace with the Algerines 
 upon the most favourable terms to the latter ; and 
 to conclude the farce, sent them another ship Ioav4 
 of similar materials and of superior value to those 
 presented by the English. This, my readers, i* 
 a small specimen of European policy.

 when the Spaniards sent the count O Reilly with 
 a respectable fleet, twenty-four thousand land for 
 ces, and a prodigious train of artillery, to destroy 
 the city. The count landed two-thirds of his 
 troops about a league and a half to the eastward 
 of the city ; but upon marching into the country 
 they were opposed by an immense army of na 
 tives. The Spaniards say it consisted of one hun 
 dred and fifty thousand probably exaggerated by 
 their apprehensions. This is certain, they had 
 force sufficient or superior skill, to defeat the Span 
 iards, who retreated to their ships with the loss of 
 thirteen cannon, some howitzers, and three thou

 troyed six thousand Algerines. No sooner had

 Description of the City of Algiers. 
 
 I CANNOT give so particular a description of this 
 city as I could wish or my readers may desire.. 
 Perhaps no town contains so many places imper 
 vious to strangers. The interior of the dey s pal 
 ace, and the female apartment of every house, 
 are secluded even from the natives. No one ap 
 proaches them but their respective masters ; while 
 no stranger is permitted to inspect the fortifica 
 tions ; and the mosques, or churches, are scrupu 
 lously guarded from the polluted steps of the un 
 believer. A poor slave, branded as an infidel, 
 would obtain only general information from a ro 
 sidence in the midst of them.

 Algiers is situated in a bay of that name, and 
 built upon the sea-shore, and on an eminence which 
 rises above it, and which naturally gives the dis 
 tinction of the upper and lower city. Towards 
 the sea it is strengthened with vast fortifications, 
 which are continued upon the mole which secures 
 the port from storms and assaults. I never per 
 ambulated it, but should judge that a line drawn 
 irom the west arm of the mole, and extended by 
 land until it terminated on the east, comprehend 
 ing the buildings, would measure about two miles. 
 It contains one hundred and twenty mosques, two 
 hundred and twenty public baths, and innumera 
 ble coffee-houses. The mosques are large stone 
 buildings, not lofty in proportion to their extent on 
 the ground, and have usually erected upon their 
 corners small square towers, or minarets, whence 
 the inferior priests call the people to prayers. 
 The baths are convenient buildings, lighted on 
 the top, provided with cold and warm water, 
 which you mingle at your pleasure, in small mar 
 ble cisterns, by the assistance of brass cocks. Ev 
 ery bather pays two rials at his entrance, for which 
 he is accommodated with a dressing-room contig 
 uous to the bathing cistern, towels, flesh-brushes, 
 and other conveniences, a glass of sherbet, and an 
 assistant if he chooses. The coffee-houses or 
 rooms are generally piazzas, with an awning over 
 them, projecting, from the front of the houses in 
 to the streets. Here the inhabitants delight to 
 loll, to drink sherbet, sip coffee, and chew opium, 
 r smoak tobacco steeped in a decoction of this* 
 exhilarating drug.

 I have already sketched a description of the 
 houses,and shall only add, that the roofs are nearly 
 flat, with a small declivity to cast the rain-water into 
 spouts. Algiers is tolerably well supplied with 
 spring- water, conveyed in pipes from the back 
 country ; but the Algerines, who are immoderate 
 ly attached to bathing, prefer rain-water as best 
 adapted to that use, considering it a luxury in com 
 parison with that obtained from the springs or sea* 
 
 The inhabitants say Algiers contains twenty 
 thousand houses, one hundred and forty thousand 
 believers, twenty-two thousand Jews, and six 
 thousand Christian slaves. I suspect that Alger- 
 ine vanity has exaggerated the truth ; but I can 
 not contradict it. Immediately before the census 
 of the inhabitants of the United States, I am told 
 persons who possessed much better means of cal 
 culation mis-ratell the population of the principal 
 towns most egregiously.

 and that in the year 1623, the Algerines threw off 
 their dependence on the Sublime Porte. Since 
 that time the Turkish court have made several at 
 tempts to reduce the Algerines to their subjection ; 
 and, by siding with the numerous pretenders to 
 the regency, so common in this unstable govern 
 ment, they have at times apparently effected their 
 design : while the Algerines, by assassinating or 
 dethroning those princes whose weakness or wants 
 have induced them to submit to extraneous power, 
 have reduced their dependence on the Sublime 
 Porte to a mere name. At present the grand seign 
 ior, fearful of loosing the very shadow of author 
 ity he has over them, contents himself with re 
 ceiving a tribute almost nominal ; consisting chief- 
 Jy of a present towards defraying the expenses of 
 the annual canopy, which is sent to adorn the 
 prophet s tomb at Medina : while, on the other 
 hand, the Algerines, dreading the grand seignior s 
 interference in their popular commotions, allow 
 the Sublime Porte to confirm the election of their 
 dey, and to badge his name, by affixing and ter 
 minating it with those of the principal officers of 
 the Turkish government. Hence the present dey, 
 whose real name is Hassan, is styled Vizier, which 
 is also the appellation of the grand seignior s first 
 minister. As bashaw, which terminates the dey s 
 name, is the Turkish title of their viceroys and 
 principal commanders, he makes war or peace, 
 negotiates treaties, coins money, and performs ev

 by the election of a furious soldiery, and wades 
 to the regency through the blood of his predeces 
 sor, yet he is no sooner invested with the insig 
 nia of office, than an implicit reverence is paid to 
 his commands, even by his ferocious electors ; and 
 though he often summons his divan, or council of 
 great officers, yet they are merely advisory. He 
 conducts foreign affairs at his own good pleasure ; 
 and as to internal he knows no restraint, except 
 from certain local customs, opinions, and tenets, 
 which he himself venerates in common with his 
 meanest subjects. Justice is administered in his 
 name. He even determines controversies in his 
 own person, besides being supposed virtually 
 present in the persons of his cadis or judges. If 
 he inclines to interfere in the determination of a 
 suit, upon his approach the authority of the cadis 
 ceases, and is merged in that of the dey. Some 
 customs have been intimated, which restrain the 
 dey s despotism. These relate principally to re 
 ligion, property, and females. He will not con 
 demn a priest to death ; and, although upon the 
 decease of a subject his landed property immedi 
 ately escheats to the reigning dey, yet he never 
 seizes it in the life of the possessor; and when a 
 man is executed for the highest crime, the females 
 of his family are treated with respect : nay, even 
 in an insurrection of the soldiery, when they mur 
 dered their dey, neither they nor his successor vi 
 olated the female apartments of the slain. A mere

 Revenue. 
 
 THE dey s revenue is stated by writers at seven 
 hundred thousand dollars per annum. If the lim 
 its of this work would permit, I think I could prove 
 it under-rated from a view of his expenditures. 
 It arises from a slight tax upon his subjects, a tri 
 bute from some Moors and tribes of Arabs in the in 
 terior country, a capitation tax upon the Jews, 
 prizes taken at sea, presents from foreign powers 
 as the price of peace, annual subsidies from those 
 nations with whom he is in alliance, and custom 
 ary presents made by his courtiers on his birth 
 day. To these may be added sums squeezed from 
 his bashaws in the government of the interior pro 
 vinces, and from the Jews as the price of his 
 protection. With these supplies he has to sup 
 port the magnificence of his court, defray the ex- 
 ^ensc of foreign embassies, pay his army, supply

 his navy, and repair his fortifications ; and by fre 
 quent gratuities, if he is not very successful and 
 popular, support his interest among those who have 
 the power to dethrone him. His proportion of 
 the prizes captured at sea, and the conciliatory 
 presents made by the commercial powers, are the 
 principal sources of his revenue. It is obviously 
 the policy of the dcy, by frequently infringing hk 
 treaties, to augment his finances by new capture?, 
 or fresh premiums for his friendship. A pacific 
 dey is sure not to reign long ; for, besides the dis 
 gust of the formidable body of sailors who are 
 emulous of employ, when the reigning dey has 
 once gone through the routine of seizing the ves 
 sels, receiving the presents, and concluding trea 
 ties with the usual foreign powers, he finds that 
 the annual payments secured by treaties are insuf 
 ficient for the maintenance of his necessary ^ex 
 penditures, and is therefore constrained frequently 
 to declare war as a principle of self-preservation. 
 I have been told the present dey condescended to 
 oxplak these principles to an American agent it? 
 Algiers, and grounded his capturing the American 
 shipping upon this necessity. I must, said the 
 dey, be at war with some nation, and yours must 
 have its turn. When the dey, from a pacific dis 
 position, or dread of foreign power, is at peace 
 with the world, the disgusted sailor and avaricious 
 soldier join to dethrone Mm having established 
 it as a maxim that all treaties expire with the 
 reigning dey, and must be renewed with his suc 
 cessor. This is undoubtedly the true source whence 
 spring those frequent and dreadful Convulsions In 
 the regency of -Algiers.

 man the fortifications in emergency, insurrection, 
 or invasion. Perhaps there are more of this spe

 stationed in the fortifications, and marshalled as the 
 dey s guards. The residue of the land forces are

 that of the men, except that their drawers are 
 longer, and their outside garment is like our 
 old-fashioned ridinghoods. When the ladies walk 
 the streets, they are muffled with bandages or hand 
 kerchiefs of muslin or silk over their faces, which 
 conceal all but their eyes ; and if too nearly in

 them entirely. The men usually sit cross-legged 
 upon mattresses laid upon low seats at the sides 
 of the room. They loll on cushions at their 
 meals, and after their repasts occasionally indulge 
 with a short slumber. I have such a laudable 
 attachment to the customs of my own country, that 
 I doubt whether I can judge candidly of their 
 cookery or mode of eating. The former would be 
 unpalatable, and the latter disgusting, to most 
 Americans ; for saffron is their common season 
 ing. They cook their provisions to rags or pap, 
 and eat it with their fingers; though the bettet 
 sort use spoons. Their diversions consist in as 
 sociating in the coffee-houses in the city, and in the 
 country under groves, where they smoke and chat, 
 and drink cooling, not inebriating, liquors. Their 
 more active amusements are riding and throwing the 
 dart, at both which they are very expert. They 
 sometimes play at chess and draughts, but never 
 at games of chance or for money, those being ex 
 pressly forbidden by the Alcoran.

 That extreme caution which separates the seres 
 jn elder life, is also attached to the youth. In 
 Algiers the young people never collect to dance, 
 converse, or amuse themselves with the innocent 
 gaieties of their age. Here are no theatres, balls, 
 or concerts ; and even in the public duties of 
 religion the sexes never assemble together. An 
 Algerine courtship would be as disagreeable to 
 the hale youth of New England, as a common 
 bundling would be disgusting to the Mussulman. 
 No opportunity is afforded to the young suitor to 
 search for those nameless bewitching qualities and 
 attentions which attach the American youth to his 
 mistress, and form the basis of connubial bliss ; 
 nor is the young Algerine permitted, by a thou 
 sand tender assiduities, to win the affections of 
 the future partner of his life. His choice can be 
 only directed by the rank or respectability of the 
 father of his intended bride. He never sees her 
 face until after the nuptial ceremony is performed, 
 and even some days after she has been brought 
 home to his own house. The old people fre 
 quently make the match, or, if it originates with 
 the youth, he confides his wishes to his father or 
 some respectable relation, who communicates the 
 proposal to the lady s father. If he receives it 
 favourably, the young couple are allowed to ex 
 change some unmeaning messages, by an old nurse 
 of the family. The bride s father or her next 
 male kin with the bridegroom go before the cadi, 
 and sign a contract of marriage, which is attested 
 by the relatives on each side. The bridegroom 
 *!ien pays a stipulated sum to the bride s father ;

 the nuptial ceremony is performed in private, and 
 the bridegroom retires. After some days the 
 bride is richly arrayed, accompanied by females, 
 and conveyed in a covered coach or waggon, gau 
 dy with flowers, to her husband s house. Here 
 she is immediately immured in the women s ap 
 artments, while the bridegroom and his friends 
 share a convivial feast. After some ceremonies, 
 the nature of which I could not discover, the bride 
 groom enters the women s apartment, and for 
 the first time discovers whether his wife has a 
 nose or eyes. Among the higher ranks, it is said&amp;gt; 
 the bride, after the expiration of a month, goes 
 to the public bath for women, is there received 
 -with great parade, and loaded with presents by 
 Jaer female relations, assembled on the occasion. 
 The bridegroom also receives presents from hic- 
 friends. 
 
 Within a limited time the husband may break 
 the contract, provided he will add another item 
 to that already given, return his bride with all 
 her paraphernalia, and, putting the holy Alcoran 
 to his breast, assert that he never benefited him 
 self of the rights of a husband. 
 
 Notwithstanding the apparent restraint the wo 
 men are under, they are said to be attached to 
 their husbands, and enjoy greater liberty than is 
 generally conceived. I certainly saw many wo 
 men in the streets so muffled up, and their out 
 ward garments so much alike, that their nearest 
 .relatives could not distinguish one from another,

 Their funerals are decent, but not ostentatious^, 
 I saw many. The corpse, carried up on a bier, is 
 preceded by the priests chanting passages from 
 the Alcoran in a dolorous tone. Wherever the 
 procession passes the people join in this dirge. 
 The relatives follow with the folds of their tur

 posited in vaults, those of the poor in graves. A 
 pillar of marble is erected over them, with an un 
 blown rose carved on the top for the unmarried. 
 
 At certain seasons the women of the family 
 join a procession in close habits, and proceed to 
 the tomb or grave, and adorn it with garlands

 This fortunate impostor, like all other great 
 characters in the drama of life, has been indig 
 nantly vilified by his opponents, and as ardently 
 praised by his adherents. 1 shall endeavour to 
 steer the middle course of impartiality ; neither 
 influenced by the bigoted aversion of Sales and 
 Prideaux, or the specious praise of the philosophic 
 Boulavnilliers. 
 
 Mahomet was born in the 568ih year of the 
 Christian sera. He was descended from the Core- 
 is, one of tjie noblest of the Arabian tribes. His 
 father Abdalla was a man of moderate fortune, 
 and bestowed upon his son such an education as a 
 parent in confined, if not in impoverished, circum 
 stances could confer. The Turks say he could 
 not write, because they pride themselves in de 
 crying letters ,japd because the pious among them 
 suppose his ignorance of letters a sufficient evi 
 dence of the dr ine original of the book he pub 
 lished, as received from and written by the finger 
 of Deity. 
 
 But when the Arabian authors record that he 
 was employed as a factor by his uncle Abutileb, 
 there can little doubt remain but that he was pos 
 sessed of all the literary acquirements necessary 
 to accomplish him for his business. He has been 
 stigmatized as a mere camel-driver. He had the 
 direction of camels it is true. The merchandize 
 of Arabia was transported to different regions by 
 caravans of those useful animals, of a troop of 
 which he was conductor ; but there was as much 
 difference between his station and employment, 
 and that of a common camel-driver, as between

 the supercargo of an India ship in our days, and 
 the seaman before the mast. In his capacity of 
 factor, he travelled into Syria, Palestine, and 
 Egypt ; and acquired the most useful knowledge 
 in each country. He is represented as a man of 
 a beautiful person and commanding presence. 
 By his engaging manners and remarkable atten 
 tion to business, he became the factor of a rich 
 Arabian merchant, after whose death he married 
 his widow, the beautiful Cadijah, and came into 
 the lawful possession of immense wealth, which 
 awakened in him the most unbounded ambition. 
 By the venerable custom of his nation, his polit 
 ical career was confined to his own tribe ; and 
 the patriarchal being the prominent feature of the 
 Arabian government, he could not hope to sur 
 mount the claims of elder families, even in his 
 own tribe, the genealogies of which were accu 
 rately preserved. To be the founder and proph 
 et of a new religion would secure a glorious pre 
 eminence, highly gratifying to his ambition, and 
 not thwarting the pretensions of the tribes. 
 
 Mankind are apt to impute the most profound 
 abilities to founders of religious systems, and oth 
 er successful adventurers, when perhaps they owe 
 their success more to a fortunate coincidence of 
 circumstances, and their only merit is the sagaci 
 ty to avail themselves of that tide in the affairs 
 of men which leads to wealth and honour. Per 
 haps there never was a conjuncture more favour 
 able for the introduction of a new religion than 
 tfoat of which Mahomet availed himself. He was

 been persecuted by the Athenasians into an abhor 
 rence of almost every other Christian tenet : by 
 Jews, who had fled from the vindictive emperor 
 Adrian, and who too wilfully blind to see the ac 
 complishment of their prophecies in the person of 
 our Saviour, in the midst of exile were ready to 
 contemn those prophecies which had so long de 
 luded them with a Messiah who never came : and 
 by Pagans, whose belief in a plurality of gods 
 made them the ready proselytes of any novel sys 
 tem ; and the more wise of whom were disgusted 
 with the gross absurdities of their own mythology, 
 The system of Mahomet is said to have been 
 calculated to attach all these. To gratify the 
 Arian and the Jew, he maintained the unity of 
 God ; and, to please the Pagans, he adopted many 
 of their exterpral rites, as fastings, washings, &c. 
 Certain it is, he spoke of Moses and the patriarchs 
 as messengers from heaven, and that he declared 
 Jesus Christ to be the true Messias, and the exem

 commenced writing the Alcoran. His first prose 
 lytes were of his own family, the next of his near 
 relatives. But the tribe of Corei were so famil 
 iar with the person and life of Mahomet that they 
 despised his pretensions ; and fearful lest what 
 they styled his mad enthusiasm should bring a 
 stigma upon their tribe, they first attempted to 
 reason him out of his supposed delusion ; and this 
 failing they sought to destroy him. But a special 
 messenger of heaven, who, Mahomet says, meas 
 ured ten million furlongs at every step, informed 
 him of their design, and he fled to Medina, the 
 inhabitants of which city, being already prepos 
 sessed in favour of his doctrine, received him with 
 great respect.* 
 
 He soon inspired them with the most implicit 
 confidence in the divinity of his mission, and con 
 firmed their faith by daily portions of the Alcoran,

 uounced all those who died fighting in his cause to 
 be entitled to the glory of martyrs in the heaven 
 ly paradise ; and, availing himself of some of 
 the ancient feuds among the neighbouring tribes, 
 caused his disciples in Medina to wage war upon 
 their neighbours, whom they invariably conquer 
 ed when he headed their troops. The tribe of 
 Corei, flattered by the honours paid their kinsman, 
 and confounded by the repeated reports of his 
 victories, were soon proselyted, and became after 
 wards the most enthusiastic supporters of his pow 
 er. In 627 he was crowned sovereign at Medina, 
 like the divine Melchisedec uniting in his person 
 the high titles of prophet and king. He subdued 
 the greater part of Arabia, and obtained a respect 
 able footing in Syria. He died at Medina in the 
 year 633, and in the sixty-fourth year of his age. 
 European writers, who have destroyed almost as 
 many great personages by poison as the French 
 have with the guillotine, have attributed his death 
 to a dose administered by a monk. But when we 
 consider his advanced age and public energies, we 
 need not recur to any but natural means tor tb. 
 cause his death.

 The Sects of Omar and M. 
 
 UPON the decease of the prophet his followers 
 were almost confounded. They could scarcely 
 credit their senses. They fancied him only in a 
 swoon, and waited in respectful silence until he 
 should again rise to lead them to conquest and 
 glory. His more confidential friends gathered 
 around the corpse ; and, being impressed with 
 the policy of immediately announcing his succes 
 sor, they held a fierce debate upon the subject. 
 In the Alcoran they found no direction for the 
 election, nor any successor to the caliphate point 
 ed out. They .agreed to send for his wives and 
 confidential domestics. The youngest of his 
 wives produced some writings, containing the pre 
 cious sayings of the prophet, which, she said she 
 had collected ^felier own edification. To these 
 were aftenvai^ls added stfeh observations of the 
 prophet as life H*ore intimate associates could re 
 collect, or the pdify of ihose in power invent. 
 These were annexed to th% ^cofan, and esteem-

 wife, the prophet had directed his great officers to 
 ^lect his successor from among them, and assured 
 them that a portion of his own power would rest 
 upon him. Abubeker, a friend and relative, and 
 successful leader of the forces of the prophet, by 
 the persuasions of those around, immediately en 
 tered the public mosque ; and, standing on the 
 steps of the desk from which the prophet used to 
 deliver his oracles, he informed the multitude that 
 God had indeed called the prophet to paradise, 
 and that his kingly authority and apostolic powers 
 res-ted upon him. To him succeeded Omar and 
 Osman : while the troops in Syria, conceiving 
 that Ali their leader was better entitled to suc 
 ceed than either, elevated him also to the caliph 
 ate, though he refused the dignity until he was 
 called by the voice of the people to succeed Os 
 man. Hence sprang that great schism which has 
 divided the Mussulman world ; but though divi 
 ded as to the successor of the prophet, both par 
 ties were actuated by his principles and adhered 
 jo his creed. Omar and his successors turned 
 iheir arms towards Europe ; and, under the name 
 of Saracens or Moors, possessed themselves of the 
 greater part of Spain and the Mediterranean isles ; 
 while the friends of Ali, establishing themselve* 
 as sovereigns, made equal ravages upon Persia,/&quot; 
 and even to the great peninsula of India. 
 
 The Algerines are of the sect of Omar, which . 
 like mauy other religious schisms, differs niore iu

 ARGUMENT. 
 
 The Faith of the Jllgerines. 
 
 THE Algerine doctors assert that the language of 
 the Alcoran is so ineffably pure, it can never be 
 rendered into any other tongue. To this they can 
 didly impute the miserable vitiated translations of 
 the Christians, whom they charge with having 
 garbled the sacred book, and degraded its sublime 
 allegories and metaphors into absurd tales. This 
 is certain, the portions which 1 have heard chan 
 ted at funerals and quoted in conversation ever ex 
 hibited the pur^ morality and the sublimest con 
 ceptions of the Deity. The fundamental doctrine 
 of the Alcoran is the unity of God. The evil spi 
 rit, says the Koran, is subtly deluding men into 
 the belief that there are more go^s than one, that in 
 the confusion of deities he may obtain a share of de 
 votion ; while the Supreme Being, pitying the de 
 lusions of man, has sent Abraham, Moses, Soliman,

 breathed forth the Messias of the Christian in a 
 sigh of divine pity, and lastly sent Mahomet, the 
 seal of the prophets, to reclaim men to this essen 
 tial truth. The next fundamental points in the 
 Mussulman creed are a belief in the eternal de 
 crees of God, in a resurrection and final judgment 
 to bliss or misery. Some hold with Chiristians 
 that the future punishment will be infinite, while 
 others suppose that, when the souls of the wicked 
 are purified by fire, they will be received into the 
 favour of God. They adhere to many other points 
 of practical duty : such as daily prayers, frequent 
 ablutions, acts of charity, and severe fastings ; that 
 of Rhammadin is the principal, which is similar 
 to the catholic Lent in abstinence, for the penitent 
 abstains only from a particular kind of food, while 
 he gluts himself with others perhaps more luscious. 
 The Alcoran tilso forbids games of chance and 
 the use of strong liquors ; inculcates a tenderness 
 for idiots and a respect for age. The Book of the 
 Companions of the Apostle enjoins a pilgrimage 
 to his tomb, to be made by the true believers once 
 at least in their lives ; but, though they view the 
 authority which enjoined this tedious journey di 
 vine, yet they have contrived to evade its rigour 
 by allowing the believer to perform it by proxy or 
 attorney. 
 
 Upon the whole, there do not appear to be any 
 articles in their faith which incite them to immo 
 rality, or can countenance the cruelties they com- 
 mit. Neither their Alcoran nor their priests excite 
 them to plunder, enslave, or torment. The for* 
 jner expressly recommends charity, justice, and

 mercy, towards their fellow men. I would npl 
 bring the sacred volume of our faith in any com 
 parative view with the Alcoran of Mahomet ; but 
 1 cannot help noticing it as extraordinary, that the 
 Mahometan should abominate the Christian on ac 
 count of his faith, and the Christian detest the 
 Mussulman for his creed ; when the Koran of the 
 former acknowledges the divinity of the Christian 
 Messias, and the Bible of the latter commands us 
 to love our enemies. If either would follow tfce 
 obvious dictates of his own scripture, he would 
 cfease to hate, abominate, and destroy the other.

 success ; but this is not to be expected ; as it nev 
 er can be the interest of the Sublime Porte to 
 suppress them, and the common faith of the Mus 
 sulman has more influence in uniting its professors 
 than the creed of the Christian, to the disgrace of 
 the latter : and, as the grand seignior s dominion 
 over the Algerines is little more than nominal, he is 
 anxious to conciliate their favour by affording them 
 his protection ; considering prudently, that, though 
 intractable, they are still a branch of the Mussul 
 man stock. Provoked by their insults he has some 
 times withdrawn his protection, as was the case 
 when he, by treaty with the Venetians, permit 
 ted their fleet to enter the Ottoman ports, for the 
 express purpose of destroy ing the Algerine galleys ; 
 but it is obvious the Sublime Porte meant merely 
 to chastise not to ruin them. 
 
 In the grand,seignior s wars with the Europeans, 
 the piratical states have rendered signal services, 
 and he himself not unfrequently receives valua 
 ble douceurs for exerting his supposed influence 
 over them in favour of oneor another of the contend 
 ing powers of Europe. In the siege of Gibraltar 
 by the Spaniards, during the late American war, 
 that garrison received frequent supplies of provi 
 sions from the Barbary shore ; but, by the applica 
 tion of Lewis XVI. to the Sublime Porte, the grand 
 seignior influenced the Barbary states to prohibit 
 those supplies ; and the English consul was dis 
 missed from one of them with the most pointed 
 marks of contempt. While the grand seignior 
 reaps such solid advantages from them, it is absurd 
 o think of his co-operation against them :

 can a union with the European powers be more 
 fully anticipated. Jealousy as often actuates migh- 
 ~ty nations as weak individuals. Whoever turns 
 over the pages of history attentively will there per 
 ceive that sordid passion is the impulse of action to 
 the greatest states. Commercial states are also ac 
 tuated by avarice a passion still more baneful in 
 , ; ts effects. These excite war, and are the grand 
 plenipotentiaries in the adjustment of the articles of 
 peace. Hence it is that, while every European 
 power is solicitous to enrich and aggrandise itself, 
 it can never join in any common project, the result 
 of which, it is fearful, may benefit its neighbour ; 
 and is content to suffer injury rather than its rival 
 should share in a common good. Hence also it is 
 that Christian states, instead of uniting to vindicate 
 their insulted faith, join together the cross and cres 
 cent in unholy alliance, and form degrading trea 
 ties with piratical powers ; and, as the summit of 
 political folly, present to those very powers, for 
 the purchase of their friendship, weapons to annoy 
 themselves in the first war that their avatice or 
 caprice shall wage. Nay, should ever a confeder 
 acy of the European powers be formed against 
 the Algerines, experience affords us but slender 
 hopes of its success ; for 1 will venture to assert 
 that, from the confederacy of Ahab and Jehosha- 
 phat, when they went up to battle at Ramoth 
 Gilead, to the treaty of Pilnitz, there never was 
 yet a combination of princes or nations, who, by 
 an actual union of thejr forces, attained the object 
 of their coalition. If the political finger be poin

 Conquests of the d^uke of Marl borough, as an ex 
 ception, I likewise will point to the distcacting 
 period when that conqueror was superseded by the 
 duke of Onnorid ; and the treaty of Utrecht will 
 confirm the opinion 1 have advanced. 
 
 The detail of the history of the Algerines evin 
 ces that the arms of individual states can be attend 
 ed with no decisive success. Indeed the expense 
 of an efficacious armament would defray the price 
 of the dey s friendship for years ; and the powers 
 of Europe submit to his insults and injuries from a 
 principle of economy. An absolute conquest of 
 the Algerine territory cannot be erected but by 
 invasion from the interior, through the co-operation 
 of the grand seignior or the assistance of the other 
 Barbary states. The former, 1 have shown, can 
 not be expected ; and the latter, for obvious rea 
 sons, is as little to be thought of. A permanent 
 conquest of the city and port of Algiers cannot 
 be effected without the subjection of the interior 
 country. , Temporary though spirited attacks up 
 on that city and port have never answered any sal 
 utary purpose. They may be compared to the 
 destruction of our sea-ports in our revolutionary 
 war. The port attacked bore so small a propor 
 tion to the whole, that its destruction rather served 
 to irritate than to weaken or subjugate. It should 
 be considered likewise that the houses of the Alge 
 rines are built of slight and cheap meterials ; that 
 upon the approach of an enemy the rich effects of 
 the inhabitants are easily removed in-land, while 
 nothing remains but heavy fortifications to batter, 
 and buildings which can be readilv restored to

 destroy. The following anecdote will show 
 how sensible the Algerines themselves are of these 
 advantages. When the French vice-admiral, the 
 marquis de Quesne, made his first attack on Algiers, 
 he sent an officer with a flag on shore, who magni 
 fied the force of his commander, and threatened 
 to lay the city in ashes if the demands of the mar 
 quis were not immediately complied with. The 
 dey, who had, upon the first approach of the ene 
 my, removed the aged, the females, and his rich 
 est effects, coolly inquired of the officer how much 
 the levelling his city to ashes would cost. The of 
 ficer, thinking to increase the dey s admiration 
 of the power of the grand monarque, answered 
 two millions of livres. Tell your commander, 
 said the dey, if he will send me half the money I 
 will burn the city to ashes myself.

 police seldom judges any cause of great impor 
 tance. The object of his commission seems to 
 be the detection and punishment of common cheats, 
 and to suppress broils among the vulgar; and, as 
 he has the power to adapt the punishment to the 
 enormity of the offence, he often exercises it ca

 there are many others who never meddle with suits 
 unless they are brought formally before them, 
 which is done by mere verbal complaint ; they 
 send for the parties and witnesses, and determine 
 almost as summarily as the officer of, police. I 
 confess that, when I left the Unitetlj States, the 
 golden fee, the long bill of cost, the law s delay, 
 and the writings of Honestus, had taught me to 
 view the judicial proceedings of our country with 
 a jaundiced x eye ; and, when I was made ac 
 quainted with the Algerine mode of distributive 
 justice, I yearned to see a cause determined in a 
 court where instant decision relieved the anxiety 
 and saved the purses of the parties, and where 
 no long-winded attorney was suffered to perplex 
 the judge ^yith subtle argument or musty precedent. 
 1 was soon delighted with an excellent display of 
 summary justice. Observing a collection of peo 
 ple upon a piazza, I leaned over the rails, and dis 
 covered that an Algerine cadi or judge had just 
 opened his court. The cadi was seated cross-leg 
 ged on a cushion with a slave, with a whip and 
 batien on one side ; and another with a drawn 
 scimetar oft the other. The plaintiff came for- 
 \fard arid told his story. He charged a man who 
 was in custody with having sold him a mule, which 
 he said was sound, but which proved blind and 
 lame. Several witnesses were then called, who 
 proved the contract and the defects of the mule. 
 The defendant was then called upon for his de 
 fence. He did not deny the fact, but pleaded the 
 law of retaliation, lie said he was a good Mus-

 religion, had sent a proxy to the prophet s tomb 
 at Medina, and maintained an idiot ; that he 
 never cheated any man before, but was justified 
 in what he had done, for, ten years before, the 
 plaintiff had cheated him worse in the sale of a. 
 dromedary, which proved broken-winded. He 
 proved this by several witnesses, and the plaintiff 
 could not deny it. The judge immediately or 
 dered the mule and the money paid for it to be^ 
 produced. He then directed his attendants to 
 seize the defendant, and give him fifty blows on 
 the soles of his feet for this fraud. The plaintiff 
 at every stroke applauded the cadi s justice to the 
 skies ; but no sooner was the punishment inflicted^ 
 than, by a nqd from the judge, the exulting plain 
 tiff was seized, and received the same number 
 of blows with the batten for the old affair of the 
 broken- winded- dromedary. The parties were 
 then dismissed without costs, and the judge or 
 dered an officer to take the mule, sell it at pub 
 lic outcry, and distribute the product, with the 
 money deposited, in alms to the poor. The of 
 ficer proceeded a few steps with the* mule, and I 
 thought the court had risen, when the/cadi, sup 
 posing one of the witnesses had prevaricated in 
 his testimony, called back the officer who had 
 charge of the mule, ordered the witness to receive 
 twenty-five blows of the batten, and be mounted 
 on the back of the mule with his face towards the

 that I think I have not materially varied from the 
 sentiment. I present it to the candid reader, as 
 a curious specimen of their pulpit eloquence ; and 
 as perhaps conveying a more satisfactory idea of 
 their creed than I have already attempted in the 
 account I have given of their religion. The attri 
 butes of Deity were the subject of the priest s 
 discourse ; and, after some exordium, he elevated 
 his voice and exclaimed : 
 
 GOD ALONE is IMMORTAL ! Ibraham and Soli- 
 man have slept with their fathers ; Cadijah the 
 first-born of faith, Ayesha the beloved, Omar the 
 meek, Ornri the benevolent, the companions of 
 the apostle and the Sent of God himself, all died ; 
 but God, most high, most holy, liveth for even 
 Infinities are to him as the numerals of arithmetic 
 to the sons of Adam : the earth shall vanish before 
 the decrees of his eternal destiny ; but he liveth 
 and reigneth for ever 
 
 GOD ALONE is OMNISCIENT ! Michael, whose 
 wings are ful! of eyes, is blind before him. The 
 dark night is unto him as the rays of the morning ; 
 for he noticeth the creeping of the small pismire 
 in the dark night upon the black stone, arid ap- 
 prehcndeth the motion of an atom in the open air. 
 
 GOD ALONE is OMNIPRESENT ! He toucheth the 
 immensity of space as a point. He moveth in 
 the depths of ocean, and mount Atlas is hidden 
 by the sole of his foot. He breatheth fragrant 
 odours to cheer the blessed in paradise, and en- 
 liveneth the pallid flame in the profoundest hell. 
 
 GOD ALONE is OMNIPOTENT ! He thought, and 
 worlds were created ; he frowneth, and they dh-

 ments of the damned are suspended. The thun- 
 derings of Hermon are the whisperings of his 
 voice ; the rustling of his attire causeth lightning 
 and an earthquake ; and with the shadow of his 
 garment he blotteth out the sun. 
 
 GOD ALONE is MERCIFUL i When he forged 
 his immutable decrees on the anvil of eternal wis 
 dom, he tempered the miseries of the race of Is- 
 mael in the fountains of pity. When he laid the 
 foundations of the world, he cast a look of benev 
 olence into the abysses of futurity ; and the ad 
 amantine pillars of eternal justice were softened 
 by the beamings of his eyes. He dropped a tear 
 upon the embryo miseries of unborn man ; and 
 that tear, falling through the immeasurable lapses 
 of time, shall quench the glowing flames of the 
 bottomless pit. He sent his prophet into the 
 world to enlighten the darkness of the tribes ; and 
 hath prepared the pavilions of the hour! for the re 
 pose of the true believers. 
 
 GOD ALONE is JUST ! He chains the latent 
 cause to the distant event ; and binds them both 
 immutably fast to the fitness of things. He de 
 creed the unbeliever to wander amidst the whirl 
 winds of error ; and suited his soul to future tor 
 ment. He promulgated the ineffable creed ; and 
 the germs of countless souls of believers, which 
 existed in the contemplation of Deity, expanded 
 at the sound. His justice refresheth the faithful, 
 while the damned spirits confess it in despair.

 By unremitted attention to the duties of my of

 milled to walk, inspecled every object I could 
 without giving umbrage. I sometimes strayed in 
 to that quarter of the city principally inhabiled by 
 Jews. This cunning race, since Iheir dispersion 
 by Vespasian and Titus, have contrived to com 
 pensate themselves for the loss of Palestine &quot; by 
 engrossing the wealth, and often the luxuries, of ev 
 ery other land ; and, wearied with the expecta 
 tion of that heavenly king,&quot; who shall re-possess 
 them of the holy city, and put their enemies be 
 neath their feet, now solace themselves with a 
 Messiah whose glory is enshrined in their coffers. 
 Rigidly attached to their own customs, intermar 
 rying among themselves, content to be apparently 
 wretched and despised, that they may wallow in 
 secret wealth ; and secluded in most countries 
 from holding landed property,and in almostall from 
 filling offices of power and profit, they are general 
 ly received as meet instruments to do the mean 
 drudgery of despotic courts. The wealth which 
 would render a subject too powerful, the despot 
 can trust with an unambitious Jew ; and confide 
 secrets which involve his own safety to a miserable 
 Israelite, whom he can annihilate with a nod. The 
 Jews transacl almost all the dey s private business-, 
 besides that of the negotiations of merchants. Nay, 
 if an envoy from a foreign power comes to treat 
 with the dey, he may have the parade of a pub 
 lic audience ; but if he wishes to accomplish his 
 embassy, he must employ a Jew ; and it is said 
 the dey himself shares with the Jew the very sums 
 paid him for his influence with this politic despot

 from foreign powers. They are therefore allowed 
 to assemble in their synagogues ; and have fre 
 quently an influence at the court of the dey, with 
 his great officers, and even before the civil judge, 
 not to be accounted for from the morality of their 
 conduct. Popular prejudice is generally against 
 them ; and the dey often avails himself of it by 
 heavy amercements for his protection. In the 
 year 1690, he threatened to extripate the whole 
 race in his dominions, and was finally appeased 
 by a large contribution they raised and offered as 
 an expiation of a supposed offence. It was com 
 monly reported, that the Jews in Algiers at that 
 time had procured a Christian child, which they 
 privately purified with much ceremony, fattened, 
 and prepared for a sacrifice at their feasts of the 
 passover, as a, substitute for the paschal lamb. 
 This horrid tale, which should have been despised 
 for its absurdity and inhumanity, the dey affected 
 to credit. He appointed several Mahometan 
 priests to search the habitations of the Jews imme-&amp;gt; 
 diately before the feast of the passover, who, dis 
 covering some bitter herbs and other customary 
 preparations for the festival, affected to have found 
 sufficient evidence against them ; and the mob of 
 Algiers, mad with rage and perhaps inflamed by 
 the usurious exactions of particular Jews, rushed 
 on furiously to pillage and destroy the wretched de 
 scendants of Jacob. Two houses were demolish

 nothing less than the destruction of so useful a

 who brought me provisions the cause of my con

 great earnestness ; but all the information he 
 would give was, that it was by the dey s order 
 I was confined ; and that he, with the physicians 
 and my friend the mollah, were using all their in

 to amuse myself in preparing and compounding 
 drugs, and promised to see me again as soon as he 
 could bring any good news. About a week after 
 an officer of the court, with a city judge, entered 
 my apartment, and informed me of the cause ol

 the lashes of the slave-driver, and sink myself be 
 neath the burthens of slavery, to have saved them 
 from an Algerine captivity. I could readily as 
 sure the dey s officers that 1 had not conversed with 
 rny miserable countrymen ; but, while 1 spake, the 
 idea of embracing a fellow citizen, a brother Chris 
 tian, perhaps some one who came from the same 
 state, or had been in the same town, or seen my 
 dear parents, passed in rapid succession, and I 
 was determined, betide what would, to seek them 
 the first opportunity. We were soon joined by 
 the rnollah, who repeatedly assured my examin 
 ers, that, though an infidel, 1 might be believed. 
 By his solicitation I was to be released ; but not 
 until I would bind myself by a solemn oath, ad 
 ministered after the Christian manner, that I would 
 never speak to any of the American slaves. When 
 this oath was proposed, I doubted whether to take 
 it ; but recollecting that, if I did not, I should be 
 equally debarred from seeing them, and suffer a 
 grievous confinement, which could do them no ser 
 vice, 1 consented, and bound myself never directly 
 or indirectly to attempt to visitor converse with 
 my fellow citizens in slavery. It was at the same 
 time intimated to me, that for the breach of this 
 oath I might expect to be impaled alive. Often 
 when I have drawn near the places of their con 
 finement auJ labours, I have regretted my submit 
 ting to this oath, and once was almost tempted to 
 break it, at seeing captain O Brien at some dis

 AFTER I had taken this oath the officers departed, 
 and 1 was liberated. I was now more cautious 
 in my rambles, avoided the notice of the Mus- 
 sulrnen inhabitants, and made more frequent visits 
 to that part of the city inhabited by Jews and for 
 eigners. Refreshing myself with a glass of sher

 tnan was employed to decoy me to some secret 
 place, in order to assassinate me by the direction of 
 my superiors, who might wish to destroy me in 
 this secret manner. But I had but little time for 
 these gloomy reflexions ; for opening another door 
 I was startled with a blaze of light let into apart 
 ments splendidly furnished. My conductor now 
 assumed an air of importance, requested me to 
 repose myself on a silken couch, and retired. A 
 young lady who was veiled, of a graceful person 
 and pleasing address, soon brought a plate of 
 sweetmeats and a bottle of excellent wine. The 
 old man soon re-appeared ; but so changed in his 
 habit and appearance, I could scarce recognize 
 him. He was now arrayed in drawers of the fin 
 est linen, an embroidered vest, and loose gown 
 of the richest Persian silk. He smiled at my sur 
 prise, shook me by the hand, and told me that he 
 was a Jew ; assuring me that he was with his 
 brethren under the protection of the dey. The 
 outward appearance of his house and the meanness 
 of his attire abroad were, he said, necessary, to a- 
 void envy and suspicion. But come, said he, I 
 know all about you ; I can confide in you. Come, 
 refresh yourself with a glass of this wine ; nei 
 ther Moses nor your Messiah forbid the use of it. 
 We ate of the collation, drank our wine liberally, 
 and then he introduced me to his son, whom 1 
 found laboring under a violent ague. I adminis 
 tered some sudorifics, and left directions for the 
 future treatment of my patient. Upon my depar 
 ture, the Jew put a sequin into my hand, and

 ing me to seat myself in the place be had fouwl 
 me in at the same hour the next day but one 
 afterwards ; and, in passing through the dark en 
 try, conjured me not to mention his domestic style 
 of living. The name of this Jew was Adonah 
 Ben Benjamin. I visited his son according to ap 
 pointment, and found him nearly restored to health 
 The father and son both expressed great gratitude &amp;gt; 
 but the former told me he would not pay me for 
 this visit in silver or gold, but with something 
 more valuable, by his advice. Come and see me 
 sometimes ; I know this people well, and may 
 render you more service than you expect. I af 
 terwards visited this Jew frequently, and from 
 him obtained much information. He told me, in 
 much confidence, that soon after I was taken, a 
 Jew and two ^.Igerines made a tour of the United 
 States, and sent home an accurate account of the 
 American commerce ; and that the dey was so 
 impressed with the idea of our wealth, that he 
 would never permit the American slaves to be 
 ransomed under a large premium, which must 
 be accompanied with the usual presents, as a 
 purchase of peace, and an annual tribute. Ex 
 pressing my anxiety to recover my freedom, he 
 advised me to write to some of the American 
 agents in Europe. I accordingly addressed a let 
 ter to William Carmichael, esq. charge des affaires 
 from the United States at the court of Madrid, 
 representing my deplorable circumstances and the 
 miserable state of my fellow prisoners, praying 
 the interference of our government, stating the 
 probable mode of access to the dey, and enclos-

 ing a letter to my parents. This my friend the 
 Jew promised to convey ; but as I never received 
 any answer from Mr. Carmichael, and my letters 
 never found the way to my friends, I conclude, 
 from the known humanity of that gentleman, my 
 letters miscarried. 
 
 Some time after I heard that the United States 
 had made application, through Mr Lamb, for the 
 redemption of their citizens, and 1 had hopes of 
 liberty ; intending, if that gentleman succeeded 
 in his negotiations, to claim my right to be ran 
 somed as an American citizen ; but his proposals 
 were scouted with contempt. I have sometimes 
 heard this gentleman censured for failing to accom 
 plish the object of his mission ; but very unjustly, 
 as I well remember that I, who was much inter 
 ested in his success, never blamed him at the time ; 
 and I know the ransom he offered the dey was ri 
 diculed in the common coffee-houses as extremely 
 pitiful. The few Algerines I conversed with af 
 fected to represent it as insulting. It was report 
 ed that he was empowered to offer only two hun 
 dred dollars per head for each prisoner indiscrim 
 inately, when the common price was four thou 
 sand dollars per head for a captain of a vessel, and 
 one thousand four hundred for a common fore 
 mast sailor. When this unsuccessful attempt fail 
 ed, the prisoners were treated with greater sever- 
 iry ; doubtless with a design to affright the Amer 
 icans into terms more advantageous to the dey. 
 
 Finding my hopes of release from the applica 
 tions of my country to fade, I consulted the friend 
 ly /ew, who advised me to endeavour to pay my

 own ransom, which he said might be effected with 
 my savings from my practice by the mediation of 
 a rich Jew, his relation. 1 accordingly put all 
 my savings into Adonah Ben Benjamin s hands, 
 which amounted to two hundred and eighty doU 
 lars, and resolved to add to it all I could procure, 
 To this intent 1 hoarc od up all 1 could obtain { 
 denying myself the slender refreshments of bath 
 ing, and cooling liquors, to which I had been for 
 some time accustomed. The benevolent Hebrew 
 having promised that, when I had attained the sum 
 requisite, within two or three hundred dollars, he 
 would himself advance the remainder, no miser 
 was ever more engaged than I was to increase my 
 store. After a tedious interval my prospects 
 brightened surprisingly. Some fortunate opera 
 tions which \ performed obtained me valuable 
 presents ; one to the amount of fifty dollars. My 
 stock in the Jew s hands had increased to nine 
 hundred dollars ; and to add to my good fortune 
 the Jew told me in great confidence, that, from 
 the pleasing account of the United States which 
 I had given him for I always spake of the pri 
 vileges of my native land with fervour he was 
 determined to remove with his family thither. 
 He said he would make up the deficiency in my 
 ransom, and send me home by the first European 
 vessel, with letters to a Mr. Lopez, a Jew, who, 
 he said, lived in Rhode Island or Massachusetts, 
 tD whom he had a recommendation from a relation 
 who had been in America. To Mr. Lopez he in

 learn, to agree about my ransom. He concluded 
 the contract at two thousand dollars. My friends 
 in the hospital expressed sorrow at parting with 
 ine ; and making me some pecuniary presents, I 
 immediately added them to my stock in the hands 
 of the Jew. In order to lessen the price of my 
 ransom, the contractor had old my master that he 
 was to advance the money, and take my word 
 N&amp;gt; remit it upon my return to my friends. This 
 story I confirmed. I went to the Jew s house, 
 who honestly produced all my savings ; we count* 
 fid them together, and he added the remainder, 
 tying the mooey up in two large bags. We spent 
 \ happy hour over a bottL of his best wine ; I in 
 anticipating the pleasure my parents and friends 
 would receive in recovering their son who was 
 lost, and the Jew in framing plans of commerce in 
 the United States, and in the enjoyment of his rich 
 es in a country where no despot should force from 
 him his honest gains ; and what added to my en 
 joyment was the information that a vessel was to 
 sail for Gibraltar in two days, in which he assu 
 red me he would procure me a passage. I retur 
 ned to the hospital, exulting in my happy pros* 
 pects. 1 was quite bes! :!e myself with joy. I 
 capered and danced as merrily as my youthful 
 acquaintance at a husking. Sometimes I would 
 be lost in thought, and then burst suddenly into 
 loud laughter. The next day, towards evening.

 see if he had engaged my passage, and to gratify 
 myself with conversing upon my native land. Be-

 key of the front door. I opened it hastily, and, 
 passing the entry, knocked for admittance at the 
 inner door, which was soon opened ; but, instead 
 of the accustomed splendor, all was gloomy the 
 windows darkened, and the family in tears : poor 
 Adonah Ben Benjamin had that morning been struck 
 with an apoplexy, and slept with his fathers. I 
 soon retired, as sincere a mourner as the nearest 
 kindred. I had indeed more reason to mourn than 
 I conceived; for, upon applying to his son for his 
 assistance in perfecting my freedom, which his 
 good father had so happily begun, he professed the 
 utmost ignorance of the whole transaction ; decla 
 red that he did not know the name of the agent 
 his father had employed, and gave no credit to 
 my account of the monies I had lodged with his 
 father. I described the bags. He coolly an 
 swered, that the God of his father Abraham had 
 blessed his father Adonah with many such bags. 
 I left him, distracted with my disappointment. 
 Sometimes I determined to relate the whole sto 
 ry to the director of the hospital, and apply for 
 legal redress to a cadi; but the specimen I had 
 of an Algerine law-suit deterred me. I had been 
 so inadvertent as to countenance the story that a 
 Jew was to advance the whole sum for me. If 
 I had been a Mussulman I might have attested to 
 my story ; but a slave is never admitted as an 
 evidence in Algiers, the West Indies, or the 
 Southern States. The disappointment of my 
 hopes were soon known in the hospital, though 
 the hand of Adonah Ben Benjamin had in the con- 
 rao-t remained a secret. The artful JRW

 had contracted for my ransom, fearing he should 
 have to advance the money himself, spread a re 
 port that I was immensely rich in my own country. 
 This corning to the ears of my master he raised 
 my ransom to six thousand dollars, which the wily 
 Israelite declining to pay, the contract was dis 
 solved. From my master I learned his name, and 
 waited upon him, hoping to obtain some evidence 
 of Adonah s having received my money, at least 
 so far as to induce his son to restore it. But the 
 Jew positively declared that Adonah never told 
 him other than that he Was to advance the cash 
 himself. Thus, from the brightest hopes of free 
 dom, 1 was reduced to despair, my money lost, 
 and my ransom raised. I bless a merciful God 
 that I was preserved from the desperate folly of 
 suicide. I never attempted my life ; but when I 
 lay down I often hoped that I might never awake 
 again in this world of misery. I grew dejected, 
 and my flesh wasted. The physicians recom 
 mended a journey into the country, which my 
 master approved ; for, since the report of my 
 wealth in my native land, he viewed my life as 
 valuable to him, as he doubted not but my friends 
 would one day ransom me at an exhorbitant pre 
 mium.

 of Malta, inhabited by the knights of that name, 
 who are sworn enemies of the Mahometan faith. 
 I could perceive that the sight of this island gave 
 a sensible alarm to the crew and passengers : but 
 the captain, or rather the skipper, who was a 
 blustering rough renegado, affected great courage, 
 and swore that if he had but one cannon on board 
 he would run down and give a broadside to the 
 infidel dogs. Plis bravery was soon put to the 
 test ; for, as the sun arose, we could discern plain-

 \y an armed vessel bearing down upon us. She 
 overhauled us fast, and our skipper conjectuied 
 she bore the Maltese colours. All hands were 
 now summoned to get out some light sails, and 
 several oars were put out, at which the brave skip 
 per tugged as lustily as the meanest of us. When 
 the wind lulled, and we gained of the vessel, he 
 would run on the quarters of the xebec, and hol 
 low 4 Come on you Christian dogs, 1 am ready 
 for you ! J I have some doubts whether the vessel ever 
 noticed us : if she did she despised us ; for she 
 tacked and stood to the south-west. This was no 
 sooner perceived by our gallant commander, than 
 he ordered the xebec to lay to, and swore that he 
 would pursue the uncircumcised dogs and board 
 them ; but he first would prudently ask the ap 
 probation of t^he passengers, who instantly deter 
 mined one and all that their business was such 
 that they must insist upon the captain s making 
 his best way to port. The captain consented, but 
 not without much grumbling at his misfortune in 
 losing so fine a prize ; and declared that, when 
 he had landed his passengers, he would directly 
 quit the port and renew the chase. After a smart 
 run we dropt anchor in the port of Alexandria, 
 called by the Turks Scandaroon. This is the site 
 of the ancient Alexandria, founded by Alexander 
 the Great ; though its present appearance would 
 not induce an opinion of so magnificent a founder. 
 It lies not far from the westernmost branch 6f the 
 river Nile, by which, in ancient days, it was sup 
 plied with water. The antiquarian eye may pos

 the vestiges of the ruins of its ancient grandeur ; 
 but a vulgar traveller, from the appearance of the 
 harbour choked with sand, the miserable buildings 
 and more wretched inhabitants of the town, would 
 not be led to conclude that this was the port which 
 rose triumphant on the ruins of Tyre and Car 
 thage. We here hired camels ; and being joined 
 by a number of pilgrims and traders, collected 
 irom various parts of the Levant, we proceeded 
 towards Grand Cairo, the present capital of Egypt ; 
 and after travelling three days or rather three 
 nights for we generally reposed in the heat of 
 the day, which is severe from one hour after the 
 sun s rising until it sets we came to a pretty 
 town on the west bank of the Nile, called Gize, 
 and hence passed over on rafts to the city of 
 Grand Cairo, called by the Turks Almizer, the 
 suburbs of which extend to the river ; but the 
 principal town commences its proper boundaries 
 at about three miles east of the Nile. I was now 
 within a comparatively short distance of two mag 
 nificent curiosities which I had ever been desirous 
 of beholding : the city of Jerusalem was only 
 about five days journey to the south-east, and i 
 had even caught a glimpse of the pyramids near 
 Gize. 1 went with my masters and others to see 
 a deep stoned pit in the castle, called Joseph s 
 well, and said to have been dug by the direction 
 of that patriarch. I am not antiqarian enough to 
 know the particular style of architecture of Jo 
 seph s well ; but the water was sweet and ex 
 tremely cold. The Turks say that Ptitiphar s 
 r vifc did not cease to persecute Joseph with her

 iove after he was released from prison and advan 
 ced to power ; but that the patriarch was warned 
 by a dream to dig this well, and invite her to 
 drink of the water, which she had no sooner done, 
 than one cup of it so effectually cooled her de 
 sires, that she was ever afterwards an eminent 
 example of the most frigid chastity. In ,0rand 
 Cairo we were joined by many pilgrims from 
 Palestine and the adjacent countries. The third 
 day our caravan, which consisted of three hundred 
 camels and dromedaries, set out for Medina under 
 the convoy of a troop of Mamaluke guards, a taw 
 ny, raw-boned, ill clothed people. Some of the 
 merchants and even pilgrims made a handsome ap 
 pearance in person, dress, and equipage. I was my 
 self well mounted upon a camel, and carried with 
 me only my leather wallet of drugs, which I dis 
 pensed freely v among the pilgrims ; my masters 
 receiving the ordinary pay, while I collected many 
 small sums, which the gratitude of my patients ad 
 ded to the usual fee. We passed near the north 
 arm of the Red Sea 3 and then pursued our jour 
 ney south until we struck the same arm again, 
 near the place where the learned Wortley Monta 
 gue has concluded that the Israelites, under the 
 conduct of Moses, effected their passage. The 
 breadth of the sea here is great, and the waters 
 deep and turbulent. The infidel may sneer if he 
 chooses ; but, for my own part, 1 am convinced 
 beyond a doubt, that, if the Israelites passed in 
 this place, it must have been by the miraculous 
 interposition of a divine power. I could not re 
 gain from reflecting upon the infatuated temerity

 which impelled the Egyptian king (o follow them, 
 Weil does the Latin poet exclaini-^-Qwem Deus 
 oult perdere, prius dementat ! We then travelled 
 east until we came to a small village called Ta- 
 dah. Here we filled many goat-skins with water, 
 and laded our camels with them. In addition to 
 my wallet 1 received two goat-skins or bags of 
 water upon my camel. The weight this useful 
 animal will carry is astonishing ; and the facility 
 and promptitude with which he kneels to receive 
 his rider and burden surprising. We now entered 
 the confines of Arabia Petrea, very aptly denom 
 inated the Rocky Arabia ; for, journeying south 
 east, we passed over many ridges of mountains 
 which appeared of solid rocks, while the rallies 
 and plains between them were almost a quick 
 sand. Not a tree, shrub, or vegetable, is to be 
 seen. In these vallies the sun poured intolerable 
 day, and its reflections from the land were insup 
 portable. No refreshing breeze is here felt. The 
 intelligent traveller often fears the rising of the 
 wind, which blows such sulty gales that man and 
 beast often sink beneath them, &quot; never to rise 
 again,&quot; or, when agitated into a tempest, drive 
 the sand with such tumultuous violence as to over 
 whelm whole caravans... Such indeed were the 
 stories told me as I passed ; these dreary plains. 
 The only inconvenience I sustained arose from the 
 intense heat of the sun, and the chills of the night 
 which our thin garments were not calculated to 
 exclude. On the third day after we left Tadah, 
 the water which we transported on our camels was 
 nearly expended. These extraordinary -animal*

 had not drank but once since our departure. Near 
 the middle of the fourth day, 1 observed our cam 
 els snuff the air, and soon set off in a brisk trot, 
 and just before night brought us to water. This 
 was contained in only one deep well, dug like a 
 reversed pyramid, with steps to descend on every 
 side to the depth of one hundred feet ; yet the 
 sagacity of the camel had discovered this water at 
 perhaps twenty miles distance. So my fellow 
 travellers asserted ; but I have since thought, 
 whether these camels, from frequently passing this 
 desert country, did not discover their approach to 
 water rathef from the eye noting familiar objects 
 than the actual scenting the water itself. A horse 
 that has journeyed the whole day will quicken his 
 step at night, upon a familiar road, within some 
 miles of an accustomed stable. Our escort de 
 lighted in the marvellous. Many a dreadful story 
 did they tell of poisonous winds and overwhelm 
 ing sands ; and of the fierce wandering Arabs, 
 who captured whole caravans and ate their prison 
 ers, Many a bloody battle had they fought with 
 this cruel banditti, in which, according to their 
 narratives, they always came off conquerors. Fre 
 quently were we alarmed, to be in readiness to 
 combat these savage free-booters ; though I never 
 saw but two of the wild Arabs in the whole of our 
 journey. They joined us at a little village east 
 of Islarnboul, and accosted us with great civility. 
 They were dressed in blue frocks, girded round 
 the waste with party-coloured sashes, in which 
 were stuck a pistol and a long knife. Their legs 
 were bare, and sheep-skin caps covered their head^,

 Their complexions were sallow, but their garments 
 and persons were clean. Indeed their dress and 
 address evinced them to be of a more civilized 
 race than our guards, who affected to treat them 
 with lofty hauteur ; and when they departed as 
 sured us that they were spies, and that an attack 
 from their countrymen might now be apprehended 
 with certainty ; if, said the leader of our escort,

 still more devout prostrated themselves on the 
 ground, and kissed the prints of his footsteps in 
 the sand. Though I was assured that he was fill 
 ed with divine love, and conferred felicity on all 
 who touched him, yet to outward appearance he 
 was the most disgusting contemptible object I had 
 ever seen. Figure to yourselves, my readers, a 
 little decrepit old man, made shorter by stooping, 
 with a countenance which exhibited a vacant 
 stare, his head bald, his finger and toe-nails as 
 long as hawks claws, his attire filthy, his face, 
 neck, arms, and legs begrimed with dirt and 
 swarming with vermin, and you will have some 
 faint idea of this mussulman saint. As I was too 
 reasonable to expect that holiness existed in a 
 man s exterior, v l waited to hear him speak ; anti 
 cipating from his lips the profoundest wisdom, 
 delivered in the honeyed accents of the saints in 
 bliss. At length he spake ; and his speech be 
 trayed him a mere idiot. While this astonished 
 me, it raised the respect of his admirers, who es 
 timated his sanctity in an inverse ratio to the 
 strength of his intellects. If they could have 
 ascertained that he was born an idiot, I verily 
 believe they would have adored him ; for the Ma 
 hometans are taught by their Alcoran, that the 
 souls of saints are often lodged in the bodies of 
 idiots ; and these pious souls being so intent on 
 the joys of paradise is the true reason that the ac 
 tions of their bodies are so little suited to the 
 manners of this world. This saint, however, 
 did not aspire to the sanctity of a genuine idiot

 though I fancy his modesty injured his preferment 
 for he certainly had very fair pretensions. It 
 was resolved that the holy man should go with us ; 
 and, to my great mortification and disgust, he was 
 mounted behind me on the same camel ; my Ma- 
 hometant friends probably conceiving that he 
 would so far communicate his sanctity by contact, 
 as that it might affect my conversion to their faith. 
 Whatever were their motives, in the embraces of 
 this nanseous being, with the people prostrating

 from my blessed companion to be permitted to

 of the blessed fugitive ; model of the refulgent 
 city in the celestial paradise ; and some of the

 be destroyed this city, with the prophet s remains, 
 will be transported by angels with all its inhab

 hours, as the great object of the devotions of the 
 pilgrims was Mecca. Pilgrimages are performed 
 to both places ; but those to Medina are not indis

 The Author visits Mecca : Description of the Al

 BEING freed from my blessed companion, I had 
 an agreeable journey from Medina to Mecca, 
 which is the most ancient city in all Arabia ; 
 &amp;gt;situated about two hundred miles south-east of Me 
 dina, twenty-one degrees and forty-five minutes 
 north latitude, and one hundred and sixteen de 
 grees east longitude from Philadelphia, according 
 to late American calculations. 1 saw the great 
 mosque in the centre of Mecca, which, it is 
 said, far surpasses in grandeur that of Sancta So 
 phia in Constantinople. It certainly is a very 
 august building, the roof of which is refulgent ; 
 but even the inhabitants smiled at my credulity. 
 when I observed that I had read it was covered 
 with plated gold. This mosque contains within 
 its limits the grand object of the mussulman s pil

 have been built by the hands of the patriarch 
 Abraham ; to confirm which the Arabian priests 
 show a black stone, upon which they say Abra 
 ham laid his son Isaac, when he had bound him in 
 preparation for his intended sacrifice. This stone 
 and building were great objects of veneration be 
 fore the mission of the prophet, and he artfully 
 availed himself of this popular prejudice, in ren 
 dering the highest respect to the holy house in his 
 life-time, and enjoining upon his followers, with 
 out distinction among males, to visit it once in 
 their lives. The advent of the prophet was said 
 to be announced from the four corners of the house, 
 which exhibit the four cardinal points. Few pil 
 grims are permitted to enter this sacred venerable 
 building ; but after travelling some of them per 
 haps a thousand miles, they are content to pros 
 trate themselves in the courts whiclf surround it. 
 Few Mahometans perform this pilgrimage in per 
 son ; those who do are highly respected. This 
 pilgrimage was enjoined by the prophet to be per 
 formed in person; but, when he laid this injunc 
 tion, it is not probable he anticipated the extensive 
 spread of his doctrines. So long as his disciples 
 were limited by the boundaries of Arabia, or had 
 only extended themselves over a part of Syria, 
 this pious journey was practicable and easy; but 
 when the crescent rose triumphant on the sea-coast 
 cmd most of the interior of Africa, when it shone 
 with splendor in Persia, Tartary, and Turkey, 
 and even adorned the Moorish minarit in Spain, 
 actual pilgrimage was deemed impracticable ; and

 procure a confidential friend at Grand Cairo to go 
 in the name of him at Belgrade, and perform his

 of the faithful in paradise.

 You think a Jew will always deceive in money

 my father s account. Now what do you demand

 overjoyed at his probity ; restore me my money, 
 and you are welcome to my services. This must 
 not be, said the son of Adonah, I have done wick

 the one thousand dollars, two thousand more for 
 your assistance as a physician ; and then will ad

 your word to repay me when you are able. I 
 was astonished. I seized his hand and felt his

 pulse were regular, and I knew his ability to per 
 form his promise. We will meet here on the

 now begun to doubt his promises, and blame my 
 self for the delusions of hope. By his appoint

 he professed a great friendship. It was concluded 
 that 1 should come to that spot immediately after

 U ned home with the Jew, and collected all the 
 property I could with propriety call my own ; 
 Vvhich consisted of a few clothes, and to the am 
 ount of three hundred and twenty dollars in cash. 
 As soon as it was dark, the Jew accompanied me 
 to the beach, and then took an affectionate leave of 
 me, presenting me with the value of ten dollars as 
 a loan, gravely remarking, that now I owed him. 
 three thousand and ten dollars, which he hoped I 
 would transport to him as soon as I arrived in 
 America. The Jew quitted me, and I soon dis 
 covered the approach of the boat, which I stept 
 into with a light heart, congratulating myself that 
 1 was again A FREE MAN. The boat soon rowed 
 along-side of a vessel that was laying to for us.

 villanous trick, and exchanged a tolerable slavery 
 for one perhaps more insupportable ; but should 
 have been perfectly resigned to my fate, if the 
 fear of being returned to Algiers and suffering the 
 dreadful punishment already related had not pre 
 sented itself. In the morning I requested to see 
 the captain ; and by his orders was brought upon 
 deck. To my surprise, it was not the same per 
 son who had decoyed me on board. I was con 
 founded. 1 intended to have expostulated ; but 
 could I tell a stranger, a man who appeared a 
 mussulmari by his garb, that I was a ruuaway 
 slave ? While I was perplexing myself what to say, 
 the man who had decoyed me on board appeared, 
 He was a passenger, and claimed me as his slave, 
 having purchased me, as he said, for four hund- 
 dred sequins of a Jew, my former master, and. 
 meant to carry me with him to Tunis. I was 
 now awakened to all the horrors of my situation. 
 I dared not irritate my new master by contradic 
 tions, and acquiesced in his story in dumb despair, 
 On the eighth day after we departed from Scan- 
 daroon the vessel made Cape Bona, and expected 
 soon to anchor in the port of Tunis. My master 
 had a Portuguese slave on board, who slept in the 
 birth with me. He spoke a little broken English, 
 having been formerly a sailor on board a vessel of 
 that nation. He gave me the mo?t alarming ap 
 prehensions of the cruelty of our master, but flat 
 tered me by saying that the Tunese in general 
 vrere more mild with their slaves than the Alge- 
 rines, and allowed a freer intercourse with the 
 European merchants : and by their interference 
 we might obtain our liberty. While my fellow

 slave slept, I lay agonising with the dread of en 
 tering the port of Tunis. Often did I wish that 
 some friendly rock or kindly leak would sink me 
 and my misfortunes ; and I was nigh being grat 
 ified in my desperate wishes ; for the same night 
 a tremendous storm arose, and the gale struck us 
 with such violence, that our sails were instantly 
 flittered into rags. We could not show a yard 
 of canvass, and were obliged to scud under bare 
 poles. Tbe night was excessively dark ; and, to 
 increase our distress, our ballast shifted and we 
 were obliged to cut away our masts by the board 
 to save us from foundering. The vessel righted ; 
 but being strong and light, and the hatchways be 
 ing well secured, our captain was only fearful of 
 being driven on some Christian coast. The next 
 Might the wind lulled : and the morning after the 
 sun arose clear, and we found ourselves off the 
 coast of Sardinia, and within gun-shot of an arm 
 ed vessel. She proved to be a Portuguese frigate. 
 To the confusion and dismay of our captain and 
 passengers, and to the great joy of myself and 
 fellow slave, the frigate hoisted her colours, manned 
 her boats, and boarded us. No sooner was his 
 national flag displayed than the overjoyed Portu 
 guese ran below and liberated me from my fetters, 
 hugged me in raptures, and, hauling me upon deck, 
 the first man we met was our master, whom he 
 saluted with a kick, and then spit in his face. I 
 must confess that this reverse of fortune made me 
 feel for the wretched mussulman, who stood quiv

 quested me to select my property from the plunder. 
 I was then sent on board the frigate. The cap 
 tain expressed much joy at being the means of my 
 deliverance, and told me that the Portuguese had a 
 sincere regard for the Americans ; and that he re 
 ceived express orders to protect our commerce from 
 the Barbary corsairs. The prisoners were brought 
 on board and confined below ; and after every 
 thing valuable was taken from the prize, the ship 
 stood for the Straits of Gibraltar, leaving a boat 
 to fire the Tunese vessel. I never received more 
 civility than from the officers of this frigate, la 
 compliment to them, 1 was obliged to throw my 
 Mahometan dress over the ship s side ; for they 
 furnished me with every necessary, and many or 
 namental articles of European clothing. The sur 
 geon was particularly attentive. I lent hirn some 
 assistance among the sick, his mate being unwell \

 ant], among other presents, he gave me a hand-* 
 some pocket-case of surgical instruments. After a 
 pleasant voyage, we anchored in port Logus in 
 the southern extremity of Portugal. PJere I re 
 ceived the agreeable intelligence that the United 
 States were about commencing a treaty with the 
 dey of Algiers, by the agency of Joseph Donald 
 son, junesq. which would liberate my unhappy 
 fellow citizens, and secure the American commerce 
 from future depredations. Without landing, I had 
 the good fortune to obtain a passage on board an, 
 English merchantman bound for Bristol, captain, 
 Joseph Joceline commander. We had a prospe 
 rous voyage to the Land s End ; and, very fortu 
 nately for me, just oil the little isle of Lundy, 
 spake with a brigantine bound to Chesapeak Bay, 
 captain John Harris commander. In thirty-two 
 days we made v Cape Charles, the north chop of 
 the Chesapeak, and 1 prevailed upon the cap- 
 tnin to set me on shore ; and on the third day of 
 May, 1795, I landed in my native country after 
 nn absence of seven years and one month ; about 
 six years of which I had been a slave. I purcha 
 sed a horse, and hastened home to my parents, 
 who received me as one risen from the dead. I 
 shall not attempt to describe their emotions, or 
 my own raptures. I had suffered hunger, sickness, 
 fatigue, insult, stripes, wounds, and every other 
 cruel injury; and was now under the roc f of the 
 kindest and tenderest of parents. I had been de- 
 ^rnded to a slave, and was now advanced to a 
 citizen of the freest country in the universe. I 
 had been lost to my parents, friends, and coun- 
 tvy : and now four). I, in the embraces and con-

 gratulations of the former, and the rights- and 
 protections of the latter, a rich compensation for 
 all past miseries. From some minutes I preser 
 ved I compiled these memoirs ; and, by the sol 
 icitations of some respectable friends, have been 
 induced to submit them to the public. A long 
 disuse of my native tongue will apologise to the 
 learned reader for any inaccuracies. 
 
 I now mean to unite myself to some amiable 
 woman, to pursue my practice as a physician, 
 which I hope will be attended with more success 
 than when essayed with the inexperience and 
 giddiness of youth ; to contribute cheerfully to tbe 
 support of our excellent government, which I have 
 learnt to adore in schools of despotism ; and thus 
 secure to myself the enviable character of an use 
 ful physician, a good father, and worthy FEDERAL 
 citizen. 
 
 My ardent wish is, that my fellow cifens 
 may profit by my misfortunes. If they peruse 
 these pages with attention, they will perceive the 
 necessity of uniting our federal strength to en 
 force a due respect among other nations. Let 
 us one and all endeavour to sustain the general 
 government. Let no foreign emissaries inflame 
 tis against one nation, by raking up the ashes of 
 long extinguished enmity ; or delude us into the 
 extravagant schemes of another, by recurring to 
 fancied gratitude. Our first object is union 
 among ourselves. For to no nation besides the 
 United States can that ancient saying be more

enduring personality of the Moors. At
Lisbon even, should be be a philologist,
he will find the dialect of the Portuguese
boatmen plentifully tinctured with words, phrases, and
idioms which may at once be recognized as Arabic. These
foreign admixtures grow more numerous as the region
once held by the Moorish sovereigns is reached, until in
Andalusia there are towns like Tarifa which look more
Oriental than European. But it is at Gibraltar and the
Strait which separates Spain from Morocco, Christendom
from Islam, that the nearness of the true home of the
Moors is apparent. Here, is Djebel-Tarik, “ the Mountain
of Tarik," the spot on which that invader of the country
which is still lovingly spoken of as “Andaloss” first set

side of the narrow gut, which the Scandinavians knew as
Norfa's Sound. East and west of Gibraltar the shore is
dotted at intervals by tumbling towers, where, within the
memory of man, wake-fires blazed for the purpose of
warning the country when a Moorish raid was expected ;
and half the legends which the peasants tell are filled
with gruesome memories of the days when the sea between
the Pillars of Hercules was scoured by desperate pirates,
intent on pillaging the commerce of Christendom and carry-
ing into slavery the hapless crews of the captured vessels.
The two sides of this division between Europe and Africa
do not differ widely. If the season when they are sighted
is spring, they are equally green with the early herbage,
variegated with a hundred flowers, and fragrant with the
blossoms of orange, and oleander, and prickly pear.
But autumn finds them both alike brown, and bare, and
dry. Yet it is scarcely possible to point to any other
twelve miles of water which divides two lands more the
antipodes of each other, so far as manners and faith and
future are concerned. For they intervene between the
Cross and the Crescent, between Europe with its pro-
gressive culture and Africa with its unadvancing barbarism.
In an hour we are back into the middle ages-we seem
to have steamed a thousand miles. And all this holds
true of "brown Barbary" until the exotic civilization of
Algeria is reached in one direction, and the still less native
polish of Senegambia in an opposite course. Along the
Mediterranean shore of Morocco there are a few posts to
which Spain clings tenaciously ; but along the Atlantic
sea-board Muley-El-Hassan is not offended by the flouting
of an infidel flag, until he come to Ifini, on the border of
the Empire, where Spain is supposed to have a fishing-
station-unless indeed the English trading-post at Cape

along the strand. Here for instance are Azila, and
Larache, and Mamora, with little to tempt a merchant to
tarry; and by and by a picturesque collection of white
buildings on either side of a river, over the bar of which
the breakers moan in wearisome monotony, attracts the
eye. A sea-wall with some not very dangerous looking
guns, the minarets of a few mosques, and the great tower
of Sma-Hassan behind, form a scene seemingly more sug-
gestive to the artist than to the historian. Yet this is the
twin town of Rabat-Sallee, which has a long chronicle of
blood and slaughter, and has perhaps been the scene of as
much misery as any spot between Agadir and Algiers.
For Sallee was, during several ages, the capital of those
Moslem pirates who divided with the Tunisians, Tripo-
litines, and Algerines, the evil eminence of doing more
damage to commerce than any other set of sea-robbers at
large. Over that bar has passed in tears and sadness,
hopeless as the entrants into Dante's Inferno, thousands
of Christian * captives, from the period when first this port
conceived the idea of growing wealthy by other means
* In the Barbary States religion is the great division between one
people and another. All who are not Moslems are “ Christians” if they
are not Jews, albeit their Christianity is often of the slenderest cha-
racter. Indeed, as an Arab once told me, the Jews would soon have
everything were it not that they keep their Sunday. But the “ Chris-
tians " in Morocco regarding all days alike, get just twenty-four hours
ahead of the pan-absorbing Israelites. Hence we hear in Barbary of
Christian clothes, of Christian swindlers, and even of Christian oaths.

shoaling up of their harbour no longer permitted of piracy

bulked more largely in history and romance, and were the
cause of more diplomatic missions, correspondence and
expense, than it seems possible to believe so despicable a

owning guns enough to pound this den of thieves into its
native dust.

Origin of
Morocco bary piracy is that the Moors, driven out of
Piracy. Spain, took revenge upon the Christians by
preying on their shipping. I have long seen good reasons
for doubting the universal accuracy of this statement. The
Moriscoes of Spain were for the most part an inland people
with little sea-borne commerce, and few ships of any
sort, while their Christian compatriots were in possession of
a large and powerful fleet. It is therefore difficult to
understand how a race unaccustomed to maritime war-
fare became so speedily, merely by the stimulus of hatred,
the most skilful corsairs of the years succeeding their
arrival on the opposite shores of Africa. Those who fled to
what is now Algeria and Tunis might, no doubt, have
taken more aptly to their new trade. For the Turks were
there already, and besides having at their disposal &
plentiful supply of Greek and Italian apostates, all expert
in seafaring wickedness, these Moslems had long been
accustomed to traverse the Mediterranean either as
“common carriers," or for the more congenial purpose of
obeying the mandate of the prophet touching the spoiling
of the Infidel.
But no such ready teachers were to be found in Morocco.
The truth seems to be that the Sallee men, and their
brother pirates in the few other parts of Morocco not in

the hands of Spain and Portugal, were taught their trade
by European outlaws, the majority of whom were sea-
robbers chased from the English coasts, and that they in
their turn imparted their knowledge to the latest refugees
from Spain. This is clearly shown by a statement of the
famous Captain John Smith, of Virginia, who it may be
remembered "took a turn," as Dugald Dalgetty would
have said, in the Sultan of Morocco's service. This
passage,* though of great historical value, seems to have
been strangely neglected even by those writers who profess
to obtain their information at first hand. For here we
learn that the most “ancient pyrats" on the English coast
within the threescore years over which Smith's recollection
extended, were “one Cellis, who refreshed himself upon the
coast of Wales ; Clinton and Pursser, being companions
who grew famous till Queene Elizabeth of blessed memory
hanged them at Wapping; Flemming was as expert and as
much sought for as they, yet such a friend to his country,
that discovering the Spanish Armada, he voluntarily
came to Plimouth, yeelded himselfe freely to my Lord
Admirall, and gave him notice of the Spaniards comming;
which good warning came so happily and unexpectedly
that he had his pardon and good reward.”
The vigilance of the armed merchantmen was, however,
so great, that until the peaceful reign of James I. let loose
a host of privateers or “men of warre " who had been
amply employed in the stormy times of Elizabeth, there
were very few rovers at large. They were all good patriots
enriching themselves by robbing the Queen's Enemies

along the Spanish Main. But in the early years of the
seventeenth century a host of masterless men were left at
large without anything to do, or much taste for an honest
calling. Then “ those that were poor, or had nothing but
from hand to mouth, turned Pirats : some because they
became slighted of them for whom they had got such
wealth ; some for that they could not get their due; some,
that had lived bravely, would not abase themselves to
poverty; some vainly, only to get a name ; others for
revenge, covetousnesse, or as ill; and as they found them-
selves more and more oppressed, their passions increasing
with discontent, made them turne Pirats.” Hunted out
of the European seas, hosts of these knaves retired to
Barbary, and there “turning Turk,” entered the service
of the Grand Seigneur, who by his deputies, the Dey of
Algiers, the Bey of Tunis, and the Bashaw of Tripoli, had
taken very kindly to the ancient trade of Piracy.* But
several preferred Morocco, where for a time they did
famously well. “Ward a poore English sailer, and
Dansker a Dutchman, made first here their marts, when the
Moores knew scarce how to saile a ship: Bishop was ancient
and did little hurt : but Easton got so much as made
himselfe a Marquesse in Savoy : and Ward lived like a
Bashaw in Barbary : these were the first that taught the
Moores to be men of warre.” Now and then they came to
condign grief if captured by the galleys of the Knights
of Malta, of the Pope, the Florentines, and the Genoese, or
by the Dutch and English men-of-war, on the outlook for
them. But King James was a merciful prince, when his
own life was not in peril, and pardoned whole batches of the
captured Corsair captains, though “ Gennings, Harris,

Thompson, and divers others," being taken red-handed in
Ireland, a coast much in favour with them, were duly
executed at Wapping Old Stairs. They were, however, a
lazy set of villains, rioting ashore among Jews, Turks,
Moors and worse, until their ill-gotten gains were gone,
and soon disgusted their Moslem associates. By and by
the latter having learned all they could teach, “beganne to
command them as slaves" and the worthless rapscallions
they were, one and all. In this way, Captain John Smith
tells us—and he is speaking of what he knew as well as
any of those contemporary with the events described-
thé Sallateens—as the Sallee folk were called—became so
powerful that by the advent of Charles I. they were the
terror of “all the Straights," and even of the merchantmen
in the Atlantic and in “ the narrow seas of England,"
where their armed vessels were often seen.
This explanation of the origin of the Morocco pirates is
confirmed by the fact that, on the Portuguese capturing
Mamora, they found * it a perfect kennel of European out-
laws-English, French, and Dutch, but few Italian or
Spanish—the offscourings of every port, who, like the
“squaw men” of the West, and the “ Beach Combers" of
the Pacific, led a congenial existence among the Bar-
barians. But when the Sallee Rovers first occupy a
prominent plan in history—and they appear very often in
the Public Records of the two and a half centuries between
the eras of Elizabeth and George IV.—they were to all
intents and purposes Moors, though now and then a
Renegade Captain is noted as in command.

large extent self-governing. The Emperor not only shared
in their plunder and winked at their inequity, but actually
provided the vessels, though it was not until Sallee lost
its quasi independence that the Sultan became his own
pirate, and took all the profits. Even then he preyed,
nominally at least, only on the commerce of the Christian
States with which he was at enmity, or had not been
bribed to keep at peace. In truth, he was not very
particular, disputes continually arising over the unfriendly
nations sailing under the flags of the friendly ones, and
exhibiting their “passes.” But when the Sallateens were
most flourishing, there was no pretence of favouring any
flag; and at the very time the “rovers” were bringing their
prizes into the Bou-ragreg River, there were merchants
of all nations living peacefully in the pirate town, and even
Consuls (Jews generally and traders always) accredited
to the country, and yet powerless or reluctant to interfere.
The rise of the twin-town, after the combined attack upon
it by Muley Zidan's forces by land and Charles the First
of England's fleet on the seaward side, and its elasticity
under various subsequent sieges, were due to the wealth
which the lucrative trade of the majority of the inhabitants
poured into the Corsairs capital. At all events, in the
reign of George I., when the hero of this volume made
his first involuntary visit to it, Sallee was flourishing,
and continued to prosper for many years afterwards.
This port was especially in favour with the pirates, mainly
because the others were in the hands of foreign powers.
But after Mamora, Azila, and El Arish (Larache) were
taken from Portugal, and Tangier was abandoned by
England, all of these places, and especially the first,
shared in its evil reputation, though the destruction of the
mole, the remains of which can still be seen above the

of Gibraltar, rendered the latter a less convenient shelter
than it would otherwise have been. When it suited the
Sultan's purpose, he disowned responsibility for Sallateens,
declaring, as he did at a later date in the case of the Riff
Pirates, that they were beyond his jurisdiction. `At other
times, he treated them simply as privateers who paid him
well for the privilege of preying with impunity on the
Nazarenes. Yet in January, 1745, at a date when England
was at peace with Muley Abdallah, the crew of the Inspector,
a British privateer wrecked in Tangier Bay, were seized and
detained for five years in captivity at Mequinez and Fez;
the Emperor being evidently of opinion that, as another
Moorish monarch remarked on being reproached with
breaking a treaty, a Moslem should not, like a Christian,
“ be the slave of his word.” Indeed, had Muley El-Jezîd
been able to take Ceuta, which he besieged twice towards
the close of last century, his intention was to use it as a
port from whence his galleys might sally forth for the
purpose of capturing ships passing through the Straits,
without much punctilio as to the flags which they flew.
The Moors' capacity for ship-building rarely permitted of
vessels much larger than thirty, forty, or at the outside
sixty tons being built by themselves, by the renegadoes, or
by their Christian slaves ; and even when they captured
larger craft suited for their purpose, the difficulty of
getting them over the bars of the Bou-ragreb and Sebou,
rivers which were yearly more and more shoaling up the
harbours of Sallee and Mamora, rendered them chary of
utilizing such windfalls. Muley Abdallah and his son,
Sidi Mohammed, swaggered loudly about their intention of
fitting out larger vessels capable of cruising on the high
seas. But their efforts never went very far in that direc-
tion, for by the time the latter managed to launch a
frigate of forty-five guns, with a crew of 330 men, under

the Reis Hadjj Ben Hassan Houet Shivi, the bar was
so bad that the cannon had to be unloaded into barges
before such a heavy draught vessel could enter the port.
Even Tetuan, which was tried as a harbour, was found
too exposed, in spite of the chains across the Martin
River which were jealously maintained far into this
century, for this fleet, which, if we may judge of the
remnants of it which until lately lay rotting in El
Arish–the Garden of the Hesperides—would be nowa-
days accounted a sorry task for the smallest of gun-boats
to demolish. But these heavily armed rovers, manned by
bold, desperate ruffians skilled in attack and defence,
were formidable foes for the crew of a merchant-ship of
small tonnage and few hands. Generally the Sallateens
managed to get alongside by flying false colours, or by
pretending to be Algerines, then much dreaded, and often
on some pretence or other weakened the doomed ship's
power of resistance by inducing the captain and some of
the crew to come on board their own vessel. Yet when
fighting was necessary, the Moors seldom showed any
lack of courage, boarding the enemy in gallant style after
she had been disabled by the fire of their artillery. Most
frequently they contented themselves with plundering the
ship, and then either scuttling or setting her adrift. But
the crew were invariably carried into port, for they consti-
tated the most valuable portion of the prize. The daring
of these Sallateens was occasionally remarkable, for not
only did they attack large ships, and make sudden raids
on the farms and villages of the opposite coast, but in
summer they would venture across the Bay of Biscay,
and lie under the shelter of Lundy Island ready to cut out
vessels sailing down the Bristol Channel. Now and then,
however, they met with sore disasters, and not only were
beaten off with loss, but even had the tables turned upon

them; while cases are on record in which they were tempted
to try issues with a disguised war-sloop, when, in the
words of an old song describing such an encounter-
“ The answer that we gave them,
Did sink them in the sea."
It must have been after some such mishap that, with at
view to keep the peace, the governor ordered every man to
put his thumbs in his girdle the moment the painful
theme was discussed in the street. The Chevalier Acton,
commander of a Tuscan war-ship, falling in with five of
Sidi Mohammed's “xebeks” off Cape Spartel, captured,
ran ashore, or dispersed all of them.
Indeed, the ships which the Sultans built when they
took piracy into their own hands were constantly being
lost by the clumsiness of their captains, as the “Reis"
was selected not so much for his seamanship as for his
ability to pay for any damage which the vessel in his
charge might sustain. The result was extreme caution
on his part, and, as the Emperor took all the profit, a
natural reluctance on the part of the Moors to serve as
sailors—a circumstance which led to a decline in the
number of the prizes taken. But this was not always se.
In Muley Ismaïl's reign, the Sultan claimed ten per cent of
the value of the prize : if he took more than this number
of slaves, which he generally did, the pirates were sup-
posed to receive value for them. Hence, in spite of
many of them being armed with Yho better artillery than
stones, with which the crew were so violently assailed that
they ran below and allowed their vessel to be easily
boarded, the rovers did a brisk trade. Muley Abdallah
reserved the slaves for himself, paying the pirates for
them at a low fixed rate ; but Sidi Mohammed, after
depriving Sallee-Rabat of its semi-independency, com-

rarely actuated by kindly feelings to the unfortunates.
Embittered by religious fanaticism, or by the memory
of their countrymen driven out of “ Andaloos," drowned
in the Straits, or hung at the yard-arm or toiling in
the Christian galleys, they heaped upon the prisoners
every malediction to be raked out of the foul kennel
of Moorish profanity, cursing their burnt fathers and
unveiled mothers to the remotest generation, and too
frequently emphasizing their words by blows. As
the captives defiled through the filthy lanes to the
underground dungeons-still to be seen-in Sallee, they
were hooted by the rabble, pelted by the children, and
spat upon by the women. And from the hour they left
that town, until ten days Tater, they arrived footsore and
weary in Fez or Mequinez—then the usual residence of the
Sultan-hard fare, black looks, and constant revilings
were there unvarying lot. In the interior they met with
no countrymen in a position to help them; all were either
slaves like themselves, or apostates who had forsworn
their king and their faith. But even in the coast
towns the merchants, living as they did by sufferance, and
eager to truckle to the authorities, seldom displayed much
pity for their helpless compatriots. For when they might
have been less timorously discreet, they were afraid lest
any familiarity might lead the officers to imagine that the

attention were people of consequence, and therefore likely
to fetch a heavier ransom.
In the capital, the life of the white slaves was no better.
There, after being inspected by the Emperor, they were
set to work, until overtures for their ransom arrived.
This system, it ought in justice to the Moors to be
remembered, was not long before in vogue all over
Europe. For were not sovereigns seized in passing through
the territories of rival princes, and shipwrecked mariners
treated in like manner, until their freedom could be
purchased for a sum of money proportionate to their
rank—a state of matters still kept in memory by the phrase,
“a king's ransom " ? The only difference was that the
Moors were a little behind the progress of the age in
following this fashion of a bygone period, just as they
are at the present day in selling offices when this method
of entering the Civil Service has been abandoned in the
realms of Christendom. The slavery of the times to which
we refer was dismal in the extreme. Compared with the
toil to which thousands of English sailors were put, the
life of the negroes in the Southern States of America was
& pleasure.' Muley Ismail and his successors had a mania
for building. No Moorish sovereign ever inhabiting the
same palace or the same rooms as his predecessor, the
slaves were for the most part employed in erecting houses,
or in preparing the materials for the masons. This
consisted in stamping earth mixed with lime, gravel,
and water, in order to make the “ taib" or concrete,
which after being moulded like bricks in boxes, hardens
into blocks almost as lasting as stone. The amalgamation
is accomplished by a heavy wooden stamper of about
twelve or fifteen pounds weight, being worked, as an old
slave of Muley Ismaïl has put on record, “ from the

mission or standing still.” The whish! whish ! of this
instrument is still, in the interior cities of Morocco, where
no rumble of wheels breaks the stillness of these sleepy
hives of Drowsihead, the most frequent sound which
reaches the ear. Others were engaged in digging out earth,
quarrying limestone, and burning it, or in collecting fuel
with which to heat the kilns. Among the many buildings
which they erected in Muley Abdallah's reign may be
mentioned the palace of Dar Debibeg near Fez, and in
Muley Ismaïl's an entire “town for the Jews." The
eight-span bridge over the Tensift River near the city
of Morocco is also said to have been built by the Portu-
guese captives who survived the defeat of Dom Sebastian
at that battle of Alcazar which has been the theme of so
many poems and stories, besides the famous play of George
Peele.
In those days wheeled carriages, now all but unknown
in the interior of Morocco, appear to have been in use; for
the slaves were also employed as carters, and went all day
with waggons full of building materials, drawn by bulls
and horses yoked together—this incongruous team being
nothing out of the way in a country where a camel and
a mule may be seen drawing a one-stilted plough, and
on two occasions I noted a woman and a donkey harnessed
to this primitive agricultural implement. The Christians
had even to drag the Moslem artillery. The more skilful
mechanics were set to make gunpowder, and to cast
annon-an art which died out after Christian slavery
eased—or to help the native artizans to make or repair
mall arms. Sawing, cutting, cementing, and erecting
larble pillars occupied. the time of others. The less

rudest tools was another labour to which they were
commonly put, and so careless were their overseers that
it often happened the slaves were killed or hurt by the
falling walls. Their tasks were sometimes superintended
by the Emperor Ismail in person, and if it suited his
humour he would dismount and take a turn with the
pickaxe, or the mallet. Yet his presence was even less
desired than that of the ordinary overseer; for during
the time he remained the slaves were not allowed a
moment's rest, not even to stand upright to ease their
weary backs or to get a drop of water, though the summer
SYB was so hot as to blister their half-naked bodies.
Sickness, which soon overtook the whites unused to
such toil in such a climate, was not considered any plea
for relief, and many a poor fellow worked under the
stimulus of the stick until he fell down, and was carried
off to die. They were beaten on the slightest provocation
or out of mere wantonness, and the most insulting epithets
hurled at the poor wretches, in any language of which
the drivers happened to have picked up a few words.
The daily toil over, they were housed in damp underground
cellars, or “Matamoras," or in open sheds exposed to
the rain or snow, which in winter sometimes falls to a
considerable depth in Fez and Mequinez, where ice an
inch thick is by no means unknown. Even there they
were not always free of annoyance, by the baser order
amusing themselves by throwing stones and clods of dirt
at them. “Kaffir!” or “ Unbeliever," was about the mildest
word addressed to them, and as an Arab generally applies
this term to his donkey in the interval of whacks, the
opprobriousness of the epithet may be imagined. I
To sustain a life of such unending toil the captives were
fed very sparingly on the worst of food. Sometimes they
were allowed a small sum-about 2d.—to board themselves.

Yet as they were not always permitted to go at large in
the town, and had therefore to entrust their marketing
to some Moor, they were usually cheated out of half their
dues. Clothing they had none except a few rags, so that
the most miserable beggar in Mequinez was better fed and
sheltered than the man who might a few days before have
been the master of a stout ship, or a merchant in a con-
siderable way of business. Occasionally, however, their
feet fell in pleasanter places, in so far that the Emperor
soundly bastinadoed a more than ordinarily brutal over-
seer, and solaced the injured slaves by sending them a
plentiful supply of “ Cuscussoo," the favourite Moorish
dish. Yet a few minutes later, the same uncertain-tempered
tyrant would spear a captive whose mode of work dis-
pleased him, or order him to fight with the wild animals
in his menagerie.
In very exceptional cases, the slaves enjoyed a life
Almost of freedom, being permitted to engage in trade, and
leven to keep taverns, where they made so much money
as to be able to buy their freedom. But the common
lot of a.white slave in Morocco, if not worse than that
of the captives in Algiers, Tripoli, or Tunis, was no better,
except that they were seldom employed to row in the
galleys, the Emperor not caring to risk keeping them near
the coast. All classes had to endure this misery, though
as a rule most of them were seamen, and often the higher
the position of the slave the worse he was treated, in order
to stimulate his friends to send all the sooner the large
ransom demanded for him! Often after obtaining their
liberty, the captives' constitutions were seriously injured
by their treatment in Barbary, though, judging from the
pious titles of the narratives which they wrote on their
return, and the religious reflections after the manner of
Robinson Crusoe on his island, or of Master Pellow at the

outset of his story, their moral fibre was considerably
improved by the chastening they had endured. But in
all my reading of these quaint little volumes, I cannot
remember more than one instance in which a captive's
physique was benefited by his travail among the infidels.
This exception was that of Sir Jeffrey Hudson, the peppery
dwarf of Charles I., who went into captivity eighteen
inches high, and emerged therefrom three feet and a
quarter, a result which the little man attributed to the
hard work he had to perform.
There have, however, been instances in which the slaves
utilized the experience they gained for the mutual benefit
of themselves and their relations. A romantic instance
of this is commemorated by a huge tenement in the
Canongate of Edinburgh, still known as “ Morocco Land.”
Though now inhabited by the poorest people, it bears
like many houses in that street the traces of former
grandeur. Over the alley passing under it is a Latin
legend :-
"MISERERE MEI, DOMINE : A PECCATO, PROBO, DEBITO ET MORTE
SUBITA. LIBERA ME 1.6.18"-
and from a recess above the second floor projects the
effigy of a Moor, a black naked man, with a turban and
necklace of beads. This was evidently the notion enter-
tained by the Scottish artist of 1618 regarding an African
potentate belonging to the same race as Othello, who even
yet, with a realism to which ethnology lends no coun-
tenance, is represented by a negroised personage. The
tradition attaching to this building is, that early in the
reign of James I., a Scottish girl having been captured by
a Sallee Rover, became a favourite with the then Emperor
of Morocco. Desirous of utilizing her influence for the
benefit of her brother, she sent for him, and he, proving

successful in his commercial dealings, returned home, and
erected this mansion, on the façade of which he set up the
effigy of his imperial brother-in-law and benefactor. This
is one legend. But there are several others, and possibly
the following alternative one is quite as picturesque, and
perhaps not less historical. It is to the effect that soon after
the accession of Charles I., the house of the Lord Provost
-or chief magistrate—was set on fire by a mob led
by Andrew Gray, the scapegrace cadet of a noble
family, who, in spite of all the influence brought to bear
upon the judges, was condemned to be hanged. But
before the day appointed for his execution arrived, the
culprit managed to escape, and was forgotten, until, many
years subsequently, a Barbary pirate appeared in the
Frith of Forth, and demanded an enormous ransom from
the city. At that hour the town was so depopulated by
the plague that there were not sixty able-bodied men
capable of resisting the fierce Corsairs. The stricken
citizens had perforce, therefore, to agree to their terms.
But the Provost was unable to send his son as a hostage
for the fulfilment of the contract, for his only child was
a daughter, and she was dying of the epidemic. On
hearing this the pirate captain declared that he had an
elixir which would cure her, and that if he failed, the city
should get quit of the promised ransom. The lady was
cured, and then the pirate-physician revealed his identity.
He was the fugitive Andrew Gray, who, entering the
service of the Emperor of Morocco, had returned on board
this pirate ship determined to take vengeance on the city
which had so despitefully used him. But love was then
as now " the lord of all,” and so the Sallee Reis abjured
roving, married the Provost's daughter, and died a sober
citizen in the town where he had begun life so untowardly.
He it was, according to this version, who fixed the

Emperor's bust on the house to which he brought his
bride, and where in his piratical days be cured her of
the plague. This was in 1645, the year in which Muley
El. Valid; the most clement of the El-hhoseini dynasty,
died, and his brother Muley Ahmed-Sceikh, last of the
sons of Muley Zidan, began his indolent reign. History,
very fragmentary so far as the Morocco of those times
is concerned, has preserved no trace of this repentant
renegade. But, curiously enough, Sir Daniel Wilson, the
eminent archæologist, tells us that though the existing title-
deeds of Morocco Land do not extend further back than
1731, the owner at that date was one John Gray, who
might therefore have been a descendant of the Sallee
Rover and the Provost’s daughter.
How far this pretty tale is true cannot now be known for
certain. But except that it is doubtful whether in 1645
the Sultan of Morocco had any vessels large enough to
venture as far as Scotland, there is nothing in either
variant not in accordance with actual incidents in the
romantic chronicles of Moroquin slavery. The mother of
Muley Abdallah--the astute Lalla Yoneta or Khoneta-is
said to have been an English captive, and among the many
other wives of Muley Ismaïl were ladies of Spanish, English,
Greek, and other European nationalities. Thus the
mother of Muley El-Valid was a Spaniard, and that of
Muley es Shereef—often mentioned in Pellow's narrative-
“a Christian ” until she “turned Moor.” Early in last
century a Mrs. Shaw, an Irishwoman, was a temporary
inmate of his harem, but in 1727 she was seen in Mequinez
in rags, the wife of a Spanish renegado, and so far lost
to civilization as to have forgotten her native tongue in
the course of the nine years she had been in captivity.
Maley Ismail had even the effrontery to demand in
marriage the Malle. de Blois, afterwards Princess de

Conti, daughter of Louis XIV. of France and Mademoiselle
de la Vallière, an incident which forced the wits of Ver-
sailles into verse, of which J. B. Rousseau's lines are
perhaps not the worst :-
“ Votre beauté, grand princesse,
Porte les traits dont elle blesse,
Jusques aux plus sauvages lieux ;
L'Afrique avec vous capitule
Et les conquêtes de vos yeux
Vont plus loin que celles d'Hercule."
One of the first wives wed by Sidi Mohammed was Lalla
Seersceta, or Zazet, daughter of an Irish or—as other
legends affirm-a Hessian renegade; and one of his last
was Lalla Douvia, a member of the Genoese family of
Francischini. But though the first-named lady was the
mother of Muley El-Jezîd, the present Sultan being
descended not from that sovereign, but from his brother,
Muley Hisciam (the son of another wife), cannot, as often
said, have “Irish blood in his veins." There is, no doubt,
a tale told how the widow of an Irish sergeant of artillery
who had been employed by the father or grandfather of
Muley El-Hassan, finding favour in the Sultan's eyes, and
being a "lone woman,” accepted his Majesty's offer, and
só rose into lofty rank as the mother of the future Emperor.
But except as a confused version of Sidi Mohammed's
matrimonial venture, I cannot find any basis for this bit
of Hibernian romance. Again, some of the captives now
and then managed to obtain considerable influence over
the Sultan. Thus, Muley Ismaïl's doctor was a Spanish
slave, and the " Maestro Juan," who exercised such power
that he was denied almost nothing, seems to have been
a Catalonian captive, noted for his sincerity, discretion,
and good works. The Spanish prisoners, however, like
the Portuguese, though allowed a chaplain and a hospital
in Mequinez, were never regarded with the same goodwill

as those belonging to other nationalities. Abdallah,
Pellow's last master, would seldom permit them to be
ransomed, in revenge for the hardships inflicted upon the
Moorish captives in the galleys of Cadiz and Lisbon, and
on the Moriscoes when they were driven out of the
Peninsula. As the English did not then enslave their
captives, the Emperor treated our people rather better,
though none of them were quite pampered either by him
or by his successor. Yet Muley El-Jezîd, the “Red
Sultan," amidst all his truculence, bestowed marked
favours on the countrymen of his mother, albeit that lady
received little filial affection at his hands.
The Moors had, however, no great liking for Ransom or
Christians simply as slaves, though Muley Escap
Ismail, for ostentation's sake, kept great numbers about
him. Negroes were in every respect better servants-
unless the captive happened to be a skilled artificer—and
made no attempt to escape. This, it is needless to add,
the captured Christians never ceased to regard as a possi-
bility. Ransom was therefore what they were detained in
the hope of bringing. The wealthier only could usually
arrange for this being sent from home. The poorer ones,
if Roman Catholics, looked to the Fathers of Our Lady of
Mercy, or to the Trinitarian, or Mercenarian, or Redemp-
tionist Fathers, orders specially charged with the collection
of money for the ransom of “Christians among the
infidels," and to undertake the weary, and oftentimes
dangerous, journeys demanded by their benevolent missions.
The English bondmen lived in hope of the king sending,
as he usually did, a periodical embassy for the purpose of
obtaining the freedom of his enslaved subjects. If this
failed, there were pious benefactions like that which
Thomas Betton left in trust with the Ironmongers' Com-
pany for the express purpose of redeeming those so

unfortunate as to experience the fate which had been his.
At every church door also there were collections for the
manumission of poor sea-faring folk who had been "taken"
by Algerines or Salleteenes, so that with patience there
was always a chance of the slave seeing his native land
again. But as the experience of many of them proved,
by and by meant an indefinite number of years. Even
when the Sultan was willing to free them there were end-
less obstacles in the way, and it is feared that not
unfrequently the “ Christian merchants" and the Jews,
who somehow or other managed to squeeze a profit out of
the Nazarenes' toil, did something to retard their ransom ;
for as the Sultan did not care to be paid for his prisoners
in money, but in ammunition, arms, and the like, the
traders in the coast towns found a less lucrative customer
in him than they would otherwise have done. Nor were
the apostates very fond of seeing their countrymen who
had been more steadfast in the faith receiving the reward
of their endurance. Hence, dealing as the agents did with
a shifty despot, they had sometimes to return without
accomplishing their errand. Even when they succeeded,
the average cost was between two and three hundred
dollars for the purchase of each captive, and when
Moorish prisoners were accepted in exchange it was seldom
that the rate was lower than ten of the Faithful for one of
the Unbelievers; and when manuscripts left in Spain were,
as in one instance, accepted in barter, the ratio was fixed
in a manner quite as disproportionate.
To escape was not so easy. The captives were closely
watched, and treachery among their own number was con-
stantly to be dreaded; for just as misfortune brings out
the heroic in the humblest of souls, so does it develop the
baseness of the worser sort. All kinds of expedients were
adopted to enable the runaways to get a start before they

were missed, or to avoid pursuit when they were on the
road. In Algiers it was comparatively easy to make a
burst for freedom; for as that city is on the sea-shore
boats could be seized, and ship captains found ready to
run the risk of concealing the white slaves determined to
be free. But in Feż or Mequinez or Marrakesch * a long
journey through hostile tribes and a roadless country had
to be undertaken, and after the Europeans had abandoned
Tangier, Azila, Larache, Mamora, Mazagan, Saffi, and
Agadir, it was even more dangerous for the captive to arrive
at the sea in the hope of being able to make the European
coast. However, Christian slaves were numerous, and so
it occasionally happened that the runaway managed not to
attract attention. But if caught, the bastinado was about
the mildest punishment he could expect. l' In Muley
Ismail's day he would most likely have been tortured, or
speared, and his captors been compelled with cruel irony
to pay the Sultan for the loss he had sustained by the
death of so presumptively valuable a piece of property.
Comparatively few, therefore, had either a chance to
undertake the risk of this venture, or the courage to face
the fate which would certainly await them if they failed.

escape the misery of daily toil, and this
many a faint heart adopted at an early stage of his cap-
tivity. They “turned Moor.” In other words they became
Apostates, or, as the Spaniards call them, Renegadoes or
Renegades, by professing, in name at least, the Moham-
medan faith. Then, though it did not always ensue that
they were free to follow their own inclinations so long as
they did not leave the country, they usually received a
remission of much of their toil, since it was accounted
infamous not to treat the “convert” as a being very much

superior to his Christian brethren. The number of these
renegades was at one time very great. In 1690, it was
estimated that very few of the 2,000 people captured at the
surrender of Mamora had not abjured their faith, and that
only 400 out of the 1,800 enslaved at the fall of Larache
were “not then Moors."
And no doubt, to loose-living sailors, there was an often
irresistible temptation to take this course. The love of a
swarthy lass, the desire for an easier life, the yearning to
take vengeance on the task-masters who had so cruelly
treated them when protest was unavailing, and finally
the belief that by an outward show of Mohammedanism
their opportunities for escape would be greater, were among
the mixed motives which instigated this step. Neverthe-
less, as Pellow's experience shows, even the renegade did
not always find his exodus from the house of bondage so
easy as he had expected. The women almost invariably
adopted the faith of their captors. Then they disappeared
into the harems, and were seen of christened men no more.
Their lot, always a miserable one, was not lightened by the
hope of ransom ; for, as subjects of the Sultan—as all
renegades were regarded - they were excluded from the
bounty of the “redemptors," and from their secluded
position, escape, if ever they had any care to return in
dishonour to their native land, was all but impossible,
The captives were, however, not usually importuned to
change their religion, unless it happened that they fell into
the hands of bigots; for as there was an implied contract
that they were to be free, every Christian “turned Moor"
meant simply one slave less to his Moslem master. Nor
were they much esteemed, or trusted more than the majority
of them deserved, for the sincerity of people who so readily
turned their religious coat at the bidding of self-interest
was naturally suspected. A large number of them were,

in truth, unmitigated rascals of no creed, and ready to
play into the hands of the Moors or of the Christians alike,
and to betray both as seemed to promise most profit for
themselves. Hence an "Oodali" or Christian pervert was
-and is to this day-regarded by the Moors as only a trifle
better than an “Aselami” or turncoat Jew, who is con-
sidered as having reached about the lowest depth to which
human nature can descend. Yet Israelitish regenades are
frequent, the motive at work in their nominal conver-
sion being almost always a desire to escape the disabilities
of the race, or a hope of gaining something thereby. In
the early days of the Arab invasion of Morocco most of the
little Atlas tribes of Jews abandoned their faith, and the
late Grand Vizier, Sid Mohammed Ben Araby, uncle of the
Emperor by marriage, was the chief of one of these
supposed renegade communities, a rumour to which his
markedly Hebraic features lent ample countenance.
The renegadoes got wives, but it was seldom that they
Were permitted, like Haidee's corsair father, to wed

Most frequently they had to content themselves with
negresses, women of low degree, or the daughters of
other renegades, and thus to become a class by them-
selves. Even their children were despised. / Muley Ismail
actually ordered an investigation to be made, so that the
offspring of slaves and renegades might either be taxed or
reduced to the condition of their forefathers. In Fez and
Mequinez there are still swarms of people descended from
European ancestors, and easily distinguished by their fair
complexion, and not infrequently fair hair. Agoory, a town
where Pellow lived for many years, is almost entirely peopled
by them. Muley Ismaïl, after a renegade had attempted his

assassination, determined to have about him as few of the
Mala Casta (to use the Spanish name for them) as possible.
Accordingly, he transported about 1,500 of them to the
distant province of Draa, which, on that account, was long
known as the Land of the Apostates—and in the chief
town of that region their descendants live to this day,
little, if anything, distinguishable from the natives around
them.
Still, one or two of greater cunning, ability, or knavery,
managed to attain considerable positions in the country.
Thus several of the vilest, unable to return with safety
to their own countries, were captains of pirate vessels.
As late as 1780, “Omar," a Scotchman, was “ Reis” of a
“ zebek" of sixteen guns and 124 men; and early in last
century & Monsieur Pillet, a former French merchant
and a friend of Pellow's, was for twelve months governor
of Sallee. “One Carr," a renegade, was in 1727 Kaïd of the
Jews, and had been governor “ on the frontiers of Guinea,”
though he preferred offices less apt to incur malice; while
it is scarcely necessary to recall the romantic tale of the
Duke of Ripperda, who, to take vengeance on Spain, of
which he had been Prime Minister, crossed the Straits,
and as the Grand Vizier of Muley Abdallah did his best
to serve his adopted country, and finally, after having been
successively Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Moham-
medan, passed the closing years of his life in trying to
persuade the Moors of Tetuan that he was the last of the
Prophets.
The little esteem in which these apostates were held
is shown by the fact that Christians who had made no
pretence of adopting Islam were readily employed by the
Sultang. Thus, among the principal architects and military
engineers in the service of Sidi Mohammed and his suc-
cessors, were Cornut, a Frenchman ; Petrobelli, a Triestan;

de Pietrasanta, a Tuscan; and Chiappe, a Genoese. As a
rule the renegades were employed as soldiers, kept at
work far from the coast, or quartered in distant “ kasbahs"
until they got knocked on the head by the plundered
country people. In Muley El-Jezîd's reign Mogador was
garrisoned by 250 French turncoats—wrecked seamen who
had apostatized to save their lives-commanded by Bois-
selin, the son of a Parisian hatter, who had voluntarily
chosen the faith and service of the Sultan, and it would
appear that Pellow and others were raised to considerable
posts in the army. These voluntary apostates were, how-
ever, generally scoundrels who had left their country for their
country's good, escaped convicts from the Spanish fortresses
on the coast, or individuals who found in the license of a
semi-lawless land a life more agreeable than that to which
they would have had to submit in Europe. They therefore
seldom attempted to leave. But the captives generally
cherished secret longings in that direction.

Narrative. their home-coming was an event too rare not
to excite much attention, and though " interviewing” was
then uninvented, some particulars about them usually
found their way into the news sheets, and not infrequently
the manumitted bondman was presented to the king, in
the hope of obtaining through his Majesty's bounty a
pecuniary solace for the hardships he had undergone. As
a means of “raising the wind,” the escaped seaman some-
times, with the aid of the local schoolmaster, or other
literary character, tried to write an account of his adven-
tures, which he hawked about the country, or disposed of
by subscription. I have collected upwards of a score of
these quaintly written, badly printed, dog-eared, narrow-
margined narratives, and possess a copy of one in Dutch

the bibliographers of Batavian literature. How far these
narratives were actually the work of the ostensible writers,
it is not now easy to ascertain. Nor does it matter. They
had assistance, no doubt. The bits of fine writing, the
ponderous periods, and the occasional scraps of Latinity,
bespeak the parson; while the "padding" out of the slim
volume with unacknowledged extracts from other authors,
cheek-by-jowl with moral reflections, smacks of the literary
gentleman who lodged at “the thief-catcher's in Lewkner's
Lane, and wrote against the impiety of Mr. Rowe's
plays." For in those days, years after Defoe had penned
his deathless classic, Grub Street was very busy with the
Sallee rovers and Barbary slavery, as Robert Chetwood's
“ Adventures of Captain Boyle," and the “Voyages of
William Owen Gwin Vaughan” abundantly testify. Such
help was necessary, for, with few exceptions, the Barbary
bondmen were “no scholars.” Even when they could write,
many of them had almost forgotten their mother tongue,
and the fact that Pellow still spoke English may have been
due to his better early education, and to his continually
conversing with other English captives either in the
interior or in the coast towns.
Pellow's little-known work is perhaps the most valuable
of these personal narratives. For not only did he travel
further than most of his fellows in misfortune, but he lived
longer in Morocco. At first, I was a little suspicious of
its authenticity, mainly from the fact that several of the
pages were verbatim, and not always acknowledged, extracts
from Windus' “ Journey to Mequinez." But it was soon
evident that these interpolations had been sandwiched into
Pellow's account by the original editor in order to pad out
the book, for they were lugged in without any regard to the
sequence by a person ignorant of Morocco, and too illiterate
even to put his literary loot into his own words. Much the

same extracts appear in Troughton's account of the wreck
of the Inspector, and to some extent also in Ockley's
work, and in the English edition of Chenier's history. We
may therefore presume that in an age of no copyright,
and consequently of loose morality, Windus' oft-pirated
volume seems to have been regarded as a free warren for
the first poacher who passed that way.
The essential truthfulness of the book was however easily
demonstrable. Rivers, towns, and other localities were
mentioned which at the time were not to be found on any
map and in no work; while the phonetic spelling—though
not more phonetic than some by more scholarly travellers
of a later period—showed that the author could not have
consulted “Authorities,” otherwise he would have adopted
the usual orthography. Events are noted and men men.
tioned who, though now familiar, were at the date of his
writing strangers to European fame, and indeed were not
celebrated in print for years subsequently. Here and there,
as I have shown in the appended notes, Pellow makes
blunders when, had he been inventing a history, he would
have insured accuracy by pillaging from early accessible
books capable of supplying the necessary information.
To this may be added that the Pellow family are still
numerous in and about Penryn, and that the people men-
tioned in the course of the narrative have enabled us to
check the statements made by him. Colonel James, who
wrote a description of the Gibraltar Straits, saw the MS.
of the book, and finally, if further proof were necessary
that Thomas Pellow was a real personage, this is supplied
in a manner which admits of no possible cavil. In the
course of his narrative he casually notes that “Captain
Rassel” had arrived in Morocco, but pouchsafes no
other information regarding him. But in turning to
Braithwaite's account of Mr Russel's embassy, we find a

confirmatory description of Pellow-or Pilleau, as he spells
the name - under date Nov. 27, 1727 : “ To-day were
visited (in Mequinez] by one Pilleau, a young fellow of
good family in Cornwal but now turned Moor. He was
taken very young with Captain Pilleau his Uncle, and being
a handsome boy he was given by Muley Ismael to one of
his sons. The Christian captives gave this young man a
wonderful character, saying he endured enough to have
killed seven men, before his master could make him turn.
Pilleau being taken very young spoke the Arabick language
as well as the Moors, and having traversed this vast country
even to the frontier of Guinea, was capable of giving a very
good account of it. He is at present a soldier, as all the
renegadoes are, who have no particular trade or calling;
but their allowance of pay and corn is so small that they
are in a starving condition, being obliged to rob and plun.
der for the greatest part of their subsistence ; for which
they were often killed when taken.” We also find from
other allusions that he frequently acted as interpreter for
the Embassy.
Apart, however, from its interest as a tale of strange
adventures, Pellow's narrative, written thirteen years
subsequent to the date of this interview, is valuable as a
geographical document, though, strangely enough, it had
been neglected by Renou and other commentators on the
topography of Morocco, and does not find a place in any of
the imperfect bibliographies of Moroquin literature. Yet
Pellow visited many parts of the country for the first time
and several which not improbably have not been seen by
any other European traveller. He was, moreover, a soldier
under Muley Ismaïl, Muley Debèbhi, Muley Abdelmalek, and
-Muley Abdallah, and was an eye-witness to most of the
sanguinary episodes of their reigns. His tale appears to
have been compiled by the aid of notes of some kind

omission of some of the passages stolen from other authors,
the body of this volume is a full reprint of the mariner's

not been altered, for the author evidently wrote them with-
out much idea of Arabic orthography; so that any attempt

appended will elucidate the more obscure allusions. Alto-
gether, the book may be treated as a fairly accurate picture
of Morocco between 1715 and 1738, in addition to being
an account of twenty-three years' unique experience in a
country still only partially known, and in those days even
less familiar to Europe. I am the more confirmed in this
opinion by the fact that my accomplished young friend,
Mr. Budgett-Meakin, of Tangier, who printed the greater

Morocco. so lucrative as that of the capture and enslave-
ment of Christians began to draw to a close. Europe was
getting stronger and Morocco weaker. All of the Barbary
States had been feeling the heavy hand of the Nazarenes,
and Morocco was not long to escape. In 1791, England
framed a treaty confirming one of a previous date which
gave our merchants much greater liberty than they had
hitherto enjoyed, and permitted any renegade to return to
his old faith so long as he had not appeared on three
separate days before the governor of a city or province
and the English Consul, declaring each time his resolution
to remain a Mussulman. Prisoners, were, however, still
“ taken " and still ransomed as of old. But in 1800 Muley
Suliman agreed with Spain that there should be a reciprocal
interchange of captives, and similar contracts were soon
afterwards entered into with other powers. Then, in 1817,
Suliman agreed to disarm his war vessels, and formally
put an end to the system which had so long prevailed, a

course to which he was the more readily persuaded by hear-
ing of the trouble which had befallen Tripoli, Tunis, and
Algiers, by the growing strength of the British in the
vicinity of Gibraltar, and lastly by the difficulty found in
sheltering his pirate fleets in their old haunts, owing to the
shoaling up of the river mouths.
Still, though piracy and slavery were no longer officially
recognized, they did not entirely cease. They were too
profitable. Along the wild Riff shore, where the inhabitants
scarcely recognize the authority of the Sultan, it was
perilous for a merchant ship to lie becalmed, especially in
the vicinity of the village of Beni-boogaffer, near Cape
“ Tres Forcas" (Ras ed Dir), about fifteen miles to the
westward of the Spanish presidio of Melilla. For suddenly
the natives launched their “ kareebs,” hidden in nooks or
buried under sand, and bore down upon the vessel, firing
volleys to frighten the doomed crew, who, if they did not
escape in their boats, were certain to be enslaved and
their ship pillaged and burnt. But though compelled to
labour in the fields, on a scanty allowance of poor food,
they were not actually ill-treated unless they offered resist-
ance—which was difficult, as the “kareebs" were each
manned by thirty or forty men all armed with long guns,
pistols, and daggers.
This went on up to the year 1856, when Sir John
Drummond - Hay succeeded in rescuing some prisoners,
and exacting a promise that similar conduct should not
occur again. This compact was kept; for the capture of a
Spanish vessel in 1889 was really not an act of piracy, but
an exercise of zeal on the part of the tribesmen desirous of
punishing a ship's crew engaged in contraband trade. Along
the Sûs coast, and further south, every vessel wrecked there
was looked upon by the wild Arabs as a lawful prize, and
though the Sultan used means to rescue the crew, he

invariably disclaimed responsibility for these outrages. In
this way Saugnier, Riley, Adams, Puddock, Cochelet, and
other seamen who wrote narratives of their adventures,
were enslaved. A Spanish subject of British descent-Mr.
James Butler, generally known as Butler-Abrines having
in 1868 landed on this coast, at a spot only five days'
journey by land south of Mogador, was, with two friends,
seized by the Sheik Habib ben Baruk, and held until the
Spanish Government redeemed them, after seven years'
captivity, for the sum of £5,400. Señor Butler died only
four years ago. M. Camille Douls, a young French traveller,
was the latest victim of these brigands, who treated him
with the greatest cruelty during his detention in 1887.
But though the Sultan affected to disarm his vessels, he
did not altogether lay them up in ordinary. As late as
1829 he captured the ships of Powers with which he had
not formed treaties, under a peculiarly Moorish convention
which took for granted that they who were not with him
were against him. In that year when Sir Arthur Brooke
was at Tangier, he noticed the departure of two Moorish
brigs " in the hope of pouncing upon some hapless Bremen
or Hamburg merchantmen," and mentions that Sweden
and other States, to save themselves the expense of main-
taining costly squadrons in the Mediterranean, actually
paid Muley Abd-er-Rahman good round sums by way of
propitiation.
Their escapades nevertheless cost His Shereefian Majesty
rather dearly. For in 1828 the English established a
blockade of the Morocco coast in retaliation for some
damage done by his corsairs, and in 1829 the capture of
an Austrian ship led to the bombardment of the ports of
Tetuan, Azila, and Rabat-Sallee, while there were constant
bickerings with Spain over the piratical proceedings of the
Riff men already mentioned. These difficulties, coupled

with a variety of other “outrages” more or less well
founded, culminated in the Spanish war of 1859–60, which
taught the Moors a well-remembered lesson.
The truth seems to have been that the Sultans of Morocco,
like their brethren in Tunis, Tripoli, and Algiers, yielded
only to the force majeure ; and it is now known that before
the French occupation of the last-named city demonstrated
the hopelessness of any return of the good old days, secret
embassies, with the object of establishing an anti-Christian
league, were passing backwards and forwards among these
pirate-powers of Islam. But in time, piracy was relegated
to the traditions of Morocco, though the engrained legend
that the Unbeliever was the lawful prey of the Faithful died
hard along the wilder shores of Barbary. For apart from
the long-continued robberies by the Riffians, and the plunder
and enslavement of shipwrecked mariners on the coast of
Sûs, and the eastern littoral of Tunis, which continued
until a very late date,* a spot so near Tangier as Cape
Spartel, where there is now a lighthouse, was a dangerous
locality only sixty years ago. Indeed, it was then and for a
long time subsequently perilous to wander far out of sight
of the military escort still-pro forma-sent with travellers,
in case some tribesmen should be lurking in the vicinity.
Sir Arthur Brooke, writing in 1831, remarks that "the
country Moors on all parts of the coast are constantly on
the look-out for Christians, and instantly make prisoners
of all who have either landed accidentally or have been

the French Army of Occupation, any traveller not well guarded would
assuredly, if not murdered, have been stripped to the skin. To pass
from Tripoli along the shores of the Lesser Syrtis, by Djerba, “the
Isle of the Lotos-Eaters," was perilous even for small bodies of troops,
the Bedouins being bold to recklessness.

shipwrecked. Parties that are occasionally formed, as
ours was, to visit Cape Spartel, are even subject to this :
and in one recent instance the lady of the English Vice-
Consul, who had strolled to a short distance out of sight
of the guard that attended her, was on the point of being
made a prisoner of by a body of natives who surrounded her
and her party, thinking they were alone, until undeceived
by the timely appearance of the escort.” A boat's crew
who had landed the year before, narrowly escaped being
marched to Fez, and were finally ransomed by the British
Consul in Tangier ; and still nearer our own time, the
Highland Lad transport having been becalmed off Cape
Spartel, an officer who went ashore, and incautiously pro-
ceeded a little way inland, was surrounded and carried off,
while his companions Managed to reach their vessel under
the fire of their pursuers. In spite of all the efforts of the
British Consul-General nothing more was ever heard of
him, so that the chances are he was murdered by his
merciless captors.

the slightest mishap befalling them. No one now dreams of
travelling in disguise, unless indeed he is anxious to excite
the suspicion of the Moors that his proceedings are under-

--the traveller will be taken at his own valuation. As for

esteemed than a Hebrew; while the story about seeing
Christian ears nailed to a post—which a recent tourist who
went so " disguised” had the effrontery to declare he did -
is so absurd, that we can only conclude that his power of
distinguishing the ears of different nationalities must have
been as powerful as was his capacity for being hoaxed,
or of trying to hoax others. For never in the memory of
man were such outrages committed, and to-day the main
fear of the town Moors — unless a half-crazy Dervish
cursing the Infidel dog be excepted—is lest they should in
the remotest manner incur the vengeance of the Christian
envoys at Tangier by molesting their fellow-countrymen.
The Sultan is no longer aggressive, though as reactionary
and hard to move in the paths of progress as ever. But
so far from wishing to annoy the Nazarene, his ever-present
dread is lest he should in any way embroil himself with
these peppery folk, and, as a consequence, is sadly im-
posed upon by the host of petty consular officials who,
though paid nothing, manage to make a lucrative trade
out of indemnities for injuries which were never inflicted,
and by the sale of “protections” to knaves who buy them
only to oppress others less fortunate.
The days of the Sallee Rovers are also over, and the sole
representative of the Moorish navy is now the El Hassani,
an English freight steamer, manned by a foreign crew,
though, as there has been a difficulty over the payment for
the vessel, at the hour of writing even this craft is doubt-
fully the property of the monarch after whom it is named.
The old pirate town seems given over to shoemaking and
fanaticism. Europeans are not permitted to live either in
it or in Azamoor, and an unknown Christian in exploring
its dirty alleys is apt to get stones and bad language hurled
at him with an emphasis which recalls the period when
to "swear like a Barbary Pirate" was a proverb among

seamen. A few rotting hulks recall the palmy days of
piracy, and anecdotes of the good old times form the
staple of that languid conversation which goes on as the
lazy citizens squat on their heels under the shade of the
sea wall. The old Bashaw—wbo has now made his peace
with Allah — just remembered seeing as a boy the last
gang of Christian slaves marched through Rabat; and
Abdul ben Reis-Abdul, son of the Captain-still recalls
some of the joyous tales with which his father, the rover
chief, entertained the family circle-years and years ago.
In these degenerate times it pays better to save the ship-
wrecked mariner than to enslave him, so that dozens of
stalwart fellows who when the century was young would
have been doing a brave business on the high seas, point
with honest pride to the medals they have won in rescuing
“ Roumi” * from the waves.
With Christian slavery departed also the chief motive for
renegadoism. Very few European Apostates now exist in
Morocco, and without a single exception, of which I am
aware, the hundred or so who are scattered over the country
are generally of such seamy antecedents as to justify the
Scotch characterization of a worthless scamp as a "runni.

the Spanish convict stations at Ceuta and elsewhere on
the Morocco coast, deserters from the French army, or
levanted criminals from Algeria and Spain. They are
usually employed in various subordinate positions in the
army, and the military band which discourses curious
versions of familiar tunes when the Prince of True
Believers appears in public includes numbers of these
individuals. I know of no British renegade—the last and

the most respectable of the order, a Scotchman, who
lived at Rabat, much esteemed for his intelligence and
honourable conduct, having died two years ago. Were
the history of these turncoats fully known, the story of
their lives would be a curious chapter in the annals of
human nature. One of the most romantic of these tales
was that of an old white-bearded man who, when the
French Military Commission first entered Fez in 1877, was
seen silently and sad-eyed, supported by two attendants,
contemplating a uniform with which in days gone by he
was very familiar. This aged renegade was known as Abd-
er-Rhaman; but his christened name was Count Joseph de
Saulty, formerly a lieutenant of engineers in the Army
of Algeria. In a weak moment he eloped with his com-
mandant's wife, and remained in Tunis until she died.
Then becoming painfully conscious of the grave position in
which he was placed as a deserter from the colours, he
passed into Morocco, changed his faith, and as a military
adviser of the then Sultan, whose name he took, rose high
in the imperial favour, and had his advice been listened to
might have saved Morocco from the disaster of Isly. He
died in 1881, and is buried at the gates of Fez in the ceme-
tery of Sidi Bou Bekkr el Arbi, though so thoroughly did he
put the past behind him, that his son, now occupying a high
position in the Court, is entirely ignorant of any language
except Arabic. Another renegade of. note was the English
officer still remembered as “Ingliz Bashaw," under whom
Muley El-Hassan, the present Sultan, learned the art
of war, and who was the first individual to impart any-
thing like discipline to the Moroquin army. Why he came
to Morocco is not known, and so jealously was his identity
- like that of the Count de Saulty—kept dark, that in a
recent work by the Viscount de la Martinière his real name
is declared to be unknown. At this date there can be no

reason for concealing that it was Graham; and I have been
told by those who have every reason to know that, like so
many others who incur the jealousy of the Moorish digni-
taries, he died of poison.
The majority of the Apostates are, however, the vilest of
rapscallions, in whom no trust is to be reposed, and who, if
despised by the Moors, quite deserve the low esteem in
which they are held. Yet even they are happily getting
fewer, since by a recent treaty between Spain and Morocco
all refugees from justice are to be mutually surrendered.
Otherwise, Morocco is much as it always was. Justice
is, as of old, bought and sold. Roads there are none,
except the rutty paths which droves of mules, and donkeys,
and horses, and camels have worn in the course of ages.
Oppression is the rule : fair play the exception, and the
dungeons so horrible, that the first object of a governor is
to immure in one of them some man wealthy enough to
buy freely the privilege of getting out of this dreadful den.
But though Maghreb Al Aksa—the “Furthest West”-
has been styled “Un Empire qui croule,” its stability is in
its weakness. For being always supposed on the eve of dis-
solution, the jealousy of the powers who wish to share in
the scramble, but are not yet prepared for the war which
would usher in that moral spectacle, renders the ever
tottering throne of Muley El-Hassan rather safer than
some which seem firmer “based upon a people's will."
And so, we venture to think, the Emir-al-Mumenin will
be wagging his beard in the sweet gardens of Fez, of
Mequinez, or Marrakesch, long after many a crown has
rolled in the dust of the Land of the Nazarenes.

prisoner out of captivity, as He bath, of His infinite mercy
(in His own appointed time), delivered me, His poor unworthy
servant, out of the hands of cruel and bloodthirsty men,
after a long and grievous slavery, for the space of almost
twenty-three years, in South Barbary, bringing me by the
right way to the city where I dwelt, thereby delivering me
from my prison and chains, and probably from ever-
lasting death. For ever and ever blessed be His most
holy name. Amen.
In the eleventh year of my age, the second of the reign of
our late Sovereign Lord King George the First, and of our
Lord Christ 1715, I being at the Latin School in Penryn, in
the county of Cornwall, and John Pellow, my uncle, being
about to proceed on a voyage from Falmouth to Fowey,
and thence for Genoa with pilchards, in the good ship
Francis, Valentine Enes (then of Penryn), merchant, the
owner; and I by no means liking my so early rising, and
(as I then thought) most severe discipline of the school, so
far insinuated myself into my uncle's favour as to get his
promise to obtain the consent of my parents for me to go
along with him; and which indeed he did, though not
without much difficulty, they urging the hardships which
probably I might, in my so tender years, undergo thereby
and their ominous fears of our falling into the hands of the
Moors, who were then at open war with us, and had, as
they saw by the newspapers, very lately taken some of our
ships ; so that it was with the greatest reluctance and
regret that I obtained their consent, which at last I did
and was soon rigged in my sailor's dress ; and after taking
(as it proved) my so long, long farewell of my friends, our
ship sailed from Falmouth to Fowey, where in a few days
we completed our cargo; and as soon as all other our
necessary business was dispatched, we set sail for our

desired port. Of which our voyage it cannot be expected
I should give any particular account, as I had never been
at sea before, and was entirely unacquainted with the
method of keeping a journal; but I well remember that
I soon began to repent of my rash undertaking, and
heartily wished myself back again, though even to be
again sent to the Latin school, my uncle keeping me so
close to my book that I had very little or no time allowed
me for play; and which, if I at any time presumed to
borrow, I failed not of a most sure payment by the cat
of nine tails ; so that by the time we got to Genoa I thought
I had enough of the sea, being every day, during our voyage
out, obliged (over and above my book-learning) to go up to
the main-top mast-head, even in all weather.
All which (though very irksome to me then) I now most
gratefully acknowledge, and plainly see, was only intended
for my good; and had not our sad misfortune of falling
into the hands of the Infidels, and our long unhappy
slavery prevented it, my uncle would have certainly made
me a complete sailor, as he himself was, by those who knew
him, allowed to be ; but what God thinks proper should be,
no human power can prevent.
And now, indeed, the unbappy part of my life draws
near. For having made our voyage, our cargoes out and
in, and by God's providence bound home, we were off Cape
Finisterre very unhappily surprised by two Sallee rovers,
and, together with Captain Foster, of Topsham (after such
small resistance as we could both make), taken and carried
prisoners on board of the infidels, as was also the next day
Captain Ferris of London, in a ship of much greater
strength, having twenty men, eight swivel and eight
carriage guns, though they behaved in the bravest
manner, fighting ten hours, and with a noble resolution,
putting the Moors off, after boarding them three times,

and killing many of them; but being overpowered by a
superior force they were also obliged to submit, and to
become our comrades.
It is impossible for me to describe the agony I was then
in, being separated from my uncle ; he being, together
with Briant Clarke, John Crimes, and John Dunnal (three
of our unhappy men) confined on board one of the Sallee-
teens, commanded by Ali Hacam; and myself, with Lewis
Davies, George Barnicoat, and Thomas Goodman, the
other three (our whole number consisting but of eight
persons) on board of the other, commanded by Elhash
Abdrahaman Medune,* the Admiral of Sallee, where we
were closely confined, and treated after a barbarous
manner during the space of one whole month, which the
infidels passed in looking sharp out after other prey, and
in examining into the value of our cargoes, according to
our several invoices and bills of lading, the prizes being
sent to Sallee for better security, and to leave them at more
liberty to encounter others during the time of their cruize ;
but seeing no likelihood of any more prizes, and their
provision growing short, they followed the prizes, and
found them safe at anchor on the outside of the bar of
Sallee; when, on a signal from the shore of there being
water enough on the bar to carry them over, the prizes
were ordered to weigh, and got all well in, the Salleetens
casting anchor without till the next day; when, about
noon, the infidels being in their jollity, were all on the
sudden in an extreme hurry on their discovery of a sail
standing right in from sea upon them, they crying out, in
great confusion, “ Garnoe! Garnoe!” meaning thereby
Captain Delgardenoor,t who they knew then commanded
a British man of war of 20 guns on that station; and as
they feared so it proved, for it was Garnoe indeed; but

alas ! too late for our assistance. Medune weighing his
anchor, and Ali Hacam slipping his cable, they ran both
aground on the bar, Delgardenoor following so near them
as in safety he might, some of his shot flying about them,
and some of them far beyond them, insomuch that they
were both, through means thereof, and a great sea, soon
beat to pieces ; and almost every one that could swim
swimming for his life ; but, for my part, I could swim but
very little, and which, had I attempted, the merciless sea
must soon have overwhelmed me; so I cried to Lewis
Davies, who I knew could swim very well, for assistance,
though from him I could get none, he saying (and very
truly) " that all his strength was highly necessary towards
his own preservation; and that should be take me on his
back, it would in all likelihood loose both our lives; where-
as by his throwing himself into the sea disentangled, and
I getting on the mast (which was cut down), it might be
a means of preserving both of us; ” and which, through
the wonderful and ready help of Almighty God assisting
(He having ordained us for larger and more grievous trials
and sufferings), accordingly happened : Davies committing
himself to the waves, and I myself to the mast, from
which I was taken by some people in a boat from the
shore. As for the Moors, they were under no appre-
hension of danger from the sea, leaping into it and
swimming to shore like so many dogs.
It may easily be imagined what sad terror and appre-
hension I was under in so dangerous a situation; for
though I could see nothing else by being delivered from
death than the more grievous torments in my becoming a
slave, &c., yet did I endeavour all in my power to avoid it,
and save myself. .

feeble condition conducted to two separate prisons ; myself,

six more, to old Sallee, and for three days closely shut up
there, and our allowance by the Moors . nothing but
bread and water, though I must thankfully own that we
met with some better refreshment through the goodness of
some French and Irish merchants residing there, which
was to us in our so weak and disconsolate condition of very
great service.
On the fourth day we were all, in number fifty-two,
taken out thence and sent prisoners to Mequinez; some
being put on mules, some on asses, and some on horses ;
on one of which my uncle and I were mounted together.
We travelled the first day to Lorshia, being obliged in our
way hither to pass through the woods of Sallee, which were
plentifully stored with most stately timber trees, of oaks,
and vast quantities of wild hogs, lions, tigers, and many
other dangerous creatures. The second day to the River

of Wolelsager ; the third to Darmulsultan; and the fourth

part of the country the only habitations, and which are at
the discretion of the people removed from one place to
another. At our arrival to the city, or rather indeed
a mile before we reached it, we were commanded to get
off our beasts and to take to our English shoes (that is to
say, as many of us as had any), and to put on yellow
pumps which were brought to us † by the Moors for that
purpose; and at our entrance into the city we were met

and surrounded by vast crowds of them, offering us the
most vile insults, and they could scarce be restrained from
knocking us on the head ; and which I verily believe they
would certainly have done had not the Emperor's guards
interposed; though even they could not, or at least would
not, hinder them from pulling our hair, and giving us
many severe boxes, calling us “ Caffer Billa, Darasole,"*
which signified in English that we were Hereticks, and
knew neither God nor Mahomet.
About eight o'clock we all got to the Emperor's palace ;
where, before we entered, we were first obliged to take off
our pumps, passing barefoot in at a gate called “Bednam
Sorelelg," or the “Renegado's Gate," + a Renegado Spaniard
being its keeper ; and thence through two other gates, viz.
“Bebliashey, Benauma," or, as by others called, “Bebfee-
lello” and “Bebaurbashyoub," I which brought us into
“Dareb Bastion " where Muly Smine, ş or Ishmael, the old
Emperor, was, who received us from the hands of the Sallee-
teens, giving Ali Hacam, in exchange for every one of us,
fifty ducats; but out of this was paid back again one-third,
and a tenth as a customary tribute ; and Medune, the
Admiral, for not fighting Delgardenoor, had the very
extraordinary favour bestowed upon him of losing his head.
And now are we ordered to be separated as follows, viz.

were wounded, were put to hard labour ; and the captains,
with the two wounded men, to the Spanish convent;
whenoe, after some short exemption, they were put to hard
labour also; and, after some little time, again exempted,
and sent to the house of one Mr. Ben Hattar,* a Jew, in
a place called the Judaiary (or Mella), he having procured
this of the Emperor; and, as everything relating to our
affairs passed through the hands of him and his agents,
it was, no doubt, very much to his advantage.
After some time, I was taken out of the armoury, and
given by the Emperor to Muley Spha, one of his favourite
sons (a sad villain), born of his wife Alloabenabiz,t by
whom he had in all ten children, viz., seven sons and three
daughters. My business now, for some time, was to run
from morning to night after his horse's heels; during
which he often prompted me to turn Moor, and told me, if
I would, I should have a very fine horse to ride on, and I
should live like one of his best esteemed friends. To which
I used to reply, that as that was the only command wherein
I could not readily gratify him, I humbly hoped that he
would be pleased, of his great goodness, to suspend all
future thoughts that way, for that I was thoroughly
resolved not to renounce my Christian faith, be the conse-
quence what it would. Then said he, in a most furious and
haughty manner, “Prepare yourself for such torture as
shall be inflicted on you, and the nature of your obstinacy
deserves.” When I humbly entreating him, on my knees,
not to let loose his rage on a poor, helpless, innocent
creature ; he, without making any further reply, committed
me prisoner to one of his own rooms, keeping me there
several months in irons, and every day most severely
bastinading me, and furiously screaming in the Moorish.

your finger. Of which cruelty my uncle hearing, he came
one day, and with him one John Phillips, to see if it might
be in their power to give me any relief; and which indeed
was not, although they very heartily endeavoured it,
gaining nothing by their so very kind and Christian-like
intention, but many severe blows on themselves, and on
me a more frequent repetition of them than before.
And now is my accursed master still more and more
enraged, and my tortures daily increasing; insomuch,
that had not my uncle, and some other good Christians
through his means, notwithstanding his so late ill usage
and repulse (even to the extreme hazard of their lives),
privately conveyed me some few refreshments, I must have
inevitably perished, my prison allowance being nothing
but bread and water ; so that I was, through my severe
scourging, and such hard fare, every day in expectation of
its being my last; and happy, no doubt, had I been, had
it so happened : I should certainly then have dy'd a martyr,
and probably thereby gained a glorious crown in the
kingdom of heaven; but the Almighty did not then see it
fit. My tortures were now exceedingly increased, burning
my flesh off my bones by fire; which the tyrant did, by
frequent repetitions, after a most cruel manner; insomuch,
that through my so very acute pains, I was at last con-
strained to submit, calling upon God to forgive me, who
knows that I never gave the consent of the heart, though
I seemingly yielded, by holding up my finger; and that I
always abominated them, and their accursed principle of
Mahometism, my only trust and confidence being firmly
fixed on Him, and in the all-sufficient merits of His only
Son Jesus Christ, my Saviour.

I was kept forty days longer in prison, on my refusing
to put on the Moorish habit; but I at length reflected,
that to refuse this any longer was a very foolish obstinacy,
since it was a thing indifferent in its own nature, seeing
I had already been compelled to give my assent to Ma-
hometism. Therefore, rather than undergo fresh torments,
I also complied with it, appearing like a Mahometan; and
I make no doubt but some ill-natured people think me so
even to this day. I pray God to forgive them, and that it
may never be their mishap to undergo the like trials;
and which, if it should, that they may maintain their
Christian faith no worse than I did mine.
I was now delivered once more from my prison and
chains; and, at the command of the Emperor, put to
school, to learn the Moorish language, and to write
Arabick; and in the latter I should have certainly been a
tolerable proficient, had not my master's insolence, and
violent death by the Emperor's orders, prevented it ; for
after being with him about three months, during which
he had often called me Christian dog, and most severely
beat me, it coming to the Emperor's ears, he was by his
order instantly despatched, by tossing him up, and so
breaking his neck.
After this, I was put no more to school to learn the
language, but immediately into the hands of Emhamenet
Sageer, whose business was to train up and instruct youth
how they should speak and behave before the Emperor,
and in the war; he having for such purposes under his
care about six hundred boys; and with whom I had not
been above a fortnight, before I had the charge of eighty
of them committed to me, I being made their Alcayde, *
or captain, to see they kept clean the walks (during all
intervals from exercise) in the Emperor's garden, where

he and his favourite Queen Hellema Hazzezas (in English
the beloved) were used to walk. In this station I had
not been but a very little time, when the Queen coming
one day into the walks, before I had the power to hide
myself in a little house set there for that purpose (and
which, at her approach, we were commanded always to
do), happened to see me, and the next day begged me of
the Emperor, which he readily granting, ordered us imme-
diately out one by one, till she should see the same person ;
and after the first, second, and third were presented, and
turned back again, he ordered their captain to appear,
when I instantly appeared, and the Queensaying I was the
same she would have, I was forth with given her, and by
her again to her favourite son Muly Zidan, a youth of
about eight years of age, and then resident with his mother
in the palace of Sherrers; where she, with thirty-eight of
the Emperor's concubines, and several eunuchs, were
closely shut up, and to which I was made chief porter of
the innermost door, that is to say, of the door next without
that of the entrance into the galleries leading to the several
apartments, and where none could gain admittance, but
through me; as indeed none were to be admitted, the
Emperor only excepted, nor him neither, in case he should
offer to come, without giving notice, at an unseasonable
hour; as once indeed he did, and though he had gained
admittance in at the several outer doors, yet was he by
me denied; for how could I tell it was him, when he was
on the one side, and I on the other, of a thick door close
shut; and allowing, as by his being let in at the several
outer doors, and his usual way of knocking, I might have
very little reason to doubt it, and which might likewise
have induced me to open it, yet, what did that signify to
me, when I had positive orders before (as no doubt had
all the rest) to admit none after such an hour, without

being before advised of it, and of some certain signs to be
given accordingly on the outside of the door ; and further,
my orders were, that in case any one should attempt to
enter at such an unseasonable hour, and not immediately
depart after his first and second knocking, and denials of
entrance, but should presume to knock a third time without
giving the signs as aforesaid, I should then fire through
the door—as indeed I had' now an occasion to do.
The Emperor being admitted, as aforementioned, in
at the several outer doors, and knocking at mine, I de-
manded aloud, “Who was there ? " to which I was
answered, “Muly Smine"; and which, indeed, by his
voice and usual way of knocking, I was pretty well assured
it was. However, I told him that I very much doubted
it; for that I had never known His Excellency to come at
such an unseasonable hour, without my being pre-advised
thereof; and which, as I then was not, he should at his
peril be gone, or I would present him with half a dozen
bullets through the door, which he prayed me not to do,
for that it was actually himself, and that if I would not
let him in, he would certainly chop off my head the next
day, knocking again louder than before; but, on the
contrary, if I would admit him, he would give me such a
fine horse (calling him by his name), with all the rich
furniture belonging to him, and would make me a great
man. I told him I would not do it if he would give me all
the horses and furniture in the empire ; for that as I was
entrusted and commanded by the renowned Muly Smine or
Ishmael, the most glorious Emperor in the world, to keep
that post inviolable against all impostors and intruders
whomsoever, and as I had but too much reason to believe
him such, I would not on any terms open the door, be the
consequence what it would, being thoroughly resolved not
to betray my trust; therefore it was in vain for him any

longer to persist. When he changing his note from rewards
to threats, and knocking again, I fired all the bullets which
I had ready by me in a blunderbuss, quite through the
door, which indeed (he keeping himself close on one side,
as I before imagined) could in nowise hurt him; and on
his seeing my so resolute resistance, and no likelihood of
his admittance, he returned as he came, highly threaten-
ing me for keeping him out, and as much commending
those at the several outer doors for their so readily letting
him in, assuring us that we should on neither side lose our
reward ; and indeed we did not, being very early in the
morning all ordered out, and all those who gave him ad-
mittance had some their heads cut off, others cruelly used;
and myself, after being highly commended for my fidelity,
rewarded with a much finer horse than that he offered to
give me in case I would betray my trust.
This palace of Sherrers is a very large spacious building
(as indeed are all the Emperor's houses), and certainly
prodigious strong, the walls twelve feet thick, and five
stories high, built only of fine earth and hot lime, mixed
and well incorporated by a vast number of slaves kept
for that purpose ; for it is thrown, as I may say,
into a mould, being first boarded up on each side, so
that being very well rammed together, it becomes, in a
very little time, harder and more durable than stone.* It
is covered on the top with blue tiles, ceiled in the inside,
and finely painted, and hath in it several hundred separate
apartments for his concubines and eunuchs, besides those
set apart for his favourite queen and her retinue. All his
other wives (in number no less than four thousand) being
closely shut up in several other sumptuous houses allotted
for them ; though all, as I may say - adjacent, and all
within the same enclosure.t

My lodging was between the inner door before mentioned
and that of the entrance into the galleries, leading to the
several apartments; my companions six boys, and two
young lions about half grown, being reared up there from
whelps; but becoming unruly, their removal was desired,
and complied with.
Now am I, after my hard keeping, again become in pretty
good plight, being allowed very good eatables, as beef,
mutton, and cuscassoo (of the nature of which I shall
speak by and by), I having in a manner now nothing else
to do than to eat my meat, and be careful of my young
master's and the Queen's motions, and especially those of
the latter, who I found was about to cut me out some new
work; so that I was obliged to walk like one walking on
the brink of a dangerous precipice, whence, should be
happen to make but the least wry step, he is sure to
tumble down and break his neck. The Queen, in short,
being extremely amorous, and the Emperor no less jealous
of her, which really made my condition very dangerous,
and might through some unforeseen accident (let my
behaviour be never so innocent), happen to prove of very
bad consequence to me, therefore I thought it highly
prudent to keep a very strict guard upon all my actions.
I now was strictly charged by the Emperor, on pain of
losing my life, to visit my uncle every day, he saying to
me, in a loud and vehement tone, “ Cossam billa illamattim
Shea Culsbah Occulashea bus ede Ameck Woolastan cut-

and evening, to kiss your uncle's hand, by Allah I'll cut
your head off. For if he were a brute,” says he, "you are
by nature obliged so to do.”
This, any one may suppose, as being the only command

my present inclinations could be best gratified with, did
not at all terrify me, and therefore I forthwith most
cheerfully put it in practice; but, alas ! that pleasure
was of a very short duration, he being, poor man, in a
few weeks after taken off by a violent flux, as were a little
before him Briant Clark, Thomas Crimes, and John
Dunnal, three of our unhappy men; and I shall never
forget my uncle's tender behaviour at the interment of
the latter, where I and a great many other Englishmen
happened to be. The corpse being brought to the grave,
and no particular person appointed to read the Christian
ceremony of burial, my uncle took it upon him, but
indeed he was not able (through the abundance of tears
flowing) to go through it, his speech being thereby to
that degree obstructed, that he could only now and then
utter a word imperfectly; insomuch, that he was obliged
to deliver over the book to another; and never did I see
such a mournful meeting, every one catching the con-
tagion, and all standing for a considerable time in a dead
silence, quite overwhelmed with grief.
I am now to expect no further comfort by way of my
poor uncle; and though, indeed, I might not probably
stand in so much need of him as formerly I had done, yet
was it the sorest affliction I ever met with, and I could
never put the remembrance of him out of my thoughts.
Now it is my chief business and greatest concern to
study how to oblige the Emperor, his dear Hellema, and
my young master; but the latter I confess I did not
mind, though he was by nature cruel enough, and I had
seen him, even in the seventeenth year of his age, kill his
favourite black with his own hand, by stabbing him into
the belly with a knife, and only for coming very acci-
dentally where he was feeding a pair of pigeons, and
their iying away for a few minutes. Yet, I say, I did not

much mind him, as having much higher objects to observe,
the Queen being in a particular manner kind, and often
recommending, me to the Emperor's good liking as a
careful and diligent servant, as indeed I really was, so
far as I thought might be consistent with my advantage
and safety. But I thinking this service very precarious,
and that I was every moment exposed, and in danger of
her poison, or his sword, I humbly intreated her to desire
the Emperor to find out for me some other employment,
wherein I might be less suspected, and not altogether out
of the way of obliging her; which she readily complied
with, I being directly ordered by the Emperor to quit this
dangerous office, and to wait on him at his palace for such
future commands as should be by him enjoined me. A
sudden and pleasing alteration indeed ; and though my
new business might be attended with more masculine
exercises, yet was I well satisfied that it could not be with
more danger and uneasiness, of which I was very soon
confirmed, I being strictly charged to be observant of the
Emperor's commands only, and to wait on him on all
occasions; and when he pleased to ride out, I was
generally mounted on the fine horse he gave me for my
fidelity in maintaining my post at the door, always
carrying at my girdle a club of about three feet long, of
Brazil wood, with which he used, on any slight occasion,
to knock his people on the head, as I had several times
the pleasure of beholding. For, in short (although I did
not know how soon it might have been my own fate), I did
not care how soon they were all dead; and indeed he
was of so fickle, cruel, and sanguine a nature, that none
could be even for one hour secure of life. He had many
despatched, by having their heads cut off, or by being
strangled, others by tossing, for which he had several very
dexterous executioners always ready at hand ; but scarce

63
would be on those occasions afford a verbal command, he
thinking that too mean, and his words of more value than
the life of the best of them, generally giving it by signs or
motions of his head and hand; as, for instance, when
he would have any person's head cut off, by drawing or
shrinking his own as close as he could to his shoulders,
and then with a very quick or sudden motion extending
it; and when he would have any strangled, by the quick
turn of his arm-wrist, his eye being fixed on the victims.
The punishment of "tossing" is a very particular one,
and peculiar to the Moors.
The person whom the Emperor orders to be thus
punished, is seized upon by three or four strong negroes,
who, taking hold of his hams, throw him up with all their
strength, and at the same time turning him round, pitch
him down head foremost; at which they are so dexterous
by long use, that they can either break his neck the first
toss, dislocate his shoulder, or let him fall with less hurt.
They continue doing this as often as the Emperor has
ordered, so that many times they are killed upon the
spot; sometimes they come off with only being severely
bruised ; and the person that is tossed must not stir a
limb, if he is able, while the Emperor is in sight, under
penalty of being tossed again, but is forced to lie as if he
was dead; which, if he should really be, nobody dares
bury the body till the Emperor has given orders for it.*
The Emperor's wrath is terrible, which the Christians
have often felt. One day passing by a high wall on which
they were at work, and being affronted that they did not
keep time in their strokes, as he expects they should, he
made his guards go up and throw them all off the wall,
breaking their legs and arms, knocking them on the head
in a miserable manner. Another time he ordered them
* Note 4.

to bury a man alive, and beat him down along with the
mortar in the wall.
Nor is the Emperor less cruel to the Moors, whem he'll
frequently command to be burnt, crucified, sawed in two,
or dragged at a mule's tail through the streets, till they
are torn all to pieces.
The most favourable death to die is by his hand, for
then they only lose their heads, have their brains knocked
out, or are run through the body, for which purpose he
always has his lances ready, and is very dexterous at
using them, seldom letting his hand go out for want of
practice.
In the year 1721, during the time that Commodore
Stewart was in Morocco as ambassador from England,
the Emperor despatched, in the most cruel manner, Larbe
Shott,* a man of one of the best families in Barbary, being
descended from the old Andalusian Moors, and deserved the
esteem both of his own countrymen and of us, with whom
he had lived till the time of his imprisonment; for he had
been a considerable time in Gibraltar, as a pledge from
the Bashaw to an English merchant, for the payment of
money due for goods he had supplied the Bashaw with.
Part of the crime laid to his charge was for going out of
his country, and living in Christendom a considerable time,
without the Emperor's knowledge, and having been
friendly himself with Christian women, and often been in
liquor. He was also accused of being an unbeliever, and
one of those who have invited the Spaniards to invade
Barbary.
These things being insinuated to the Emperor, after
the usual manner of that court (where everybody has it
in their power to do harm, but few to do good), brought
this poor man to his end; for early one morning he was

carried before the Emperor, who (not allowing him any
other trial, but giving way to his accusers, who said, “He
was an unbeliever, and not fit to live") commanded him
to be sawed in two; upon which he was immediately
carried to the place of execution, which is at one of the
gates of the town, and there tied between two boards and
sawed in two, beginning at the head and going downwards,
till his body fell asunder, which must have remained to
have been eaten by the dogs, if the Emperor had not
pardoned him ;-an extravagant custom, to pardon a man
after he is dead; but unless he does so, nobody dares bury
the body.
It was reported the next day after, that the Emperor
dreamt Shott had appeared to him, and asked him, “What
he had done to deserve such usage ?” telling him, “ There
would be a time when God would judge between them
both ; " which gave the Emperor so much concern, that
he sent to the place of his execution for some of the dust
his blood was spilt on, with which he rubbed himself all
over as an atonement for his crime.*

their so very high esteem and commendation, for it is
actually very good, grateful and nourishing, and is prepared

after the following manner : first, they put fine flour into
a large wooden bowl, then they pour thereon a small
quantity of water, and keep continually shaking the bowl,
till the water is drank up; then they pour on more, and
so continue to shake the bowl, till all the flour is come
into small pellets of about the bigness of Nutmegs; then
they are put out of the bowl into another utensil like a
cullender, which is made use of for straining the water off
pease, beans, or anything else of the like nature, which,
being put over the steam of a boiling pot or furnace,
wherein are fowls and other meat boiling, in the nature of
a cover, and another cover on the top of that. By the
time the meat is well boiled, so are the shot or pellets
(though indeed they call it baking), when they pour them
out into a dish, adding thereto good store of butter, some
salt, spices, and saffron, and then serve up the meat upon
it. This, I say, is excellent eating, and is no doubt used
by some in England and other countries as a regalio; and
was I of ability sufficient, I should often regale myself
with it. At their meals they never made use of knives,
forks, or spoons, every one putting in his right hand
instead of a fork, and his first two fingers thereof extended
instead of a spoon, all seating themselves in a ring on the
floor, and the meat in the middle ; and in case any one,
though unconcerned in this mess, passed by whilst they
were at it, and did not put in his fingers and eat with
them, he was accounted a very unmannerly fellow, all the
company calling him “Caultsnab,” which was as much as
to say, without breeding or manners, though indeed they
were not often guilty of this ill-manners. For my part, I
could readily have excused them if they had.
This cuscassoo of the Emperors, as being to feed about
nine hundred men, was brought out into the court in a
cart upon wheels ; when, dividing ourselves into several

companies of about seventy or eighty in a company, we
had all our messes served out from the cart in large bowls,
and set in the middle of us on the floor as before men-
tioned, sitting as close round it as possible we could.
Though I cannot say we had fowls, yet we did not want,
in lieu thereof, for good store of beef and mutton, and
which, instead of decently cutting, we with our hands
hauled to pieces, two pulling one against another; and
any one first taking hold on a piece of meat, and another,
his next neighbour, not taking speedy hold also on the
same piece, it was accounted brutish. For as they are
allowed at their meals the use only of their right hands,
therefore if a man is not so assisted by his neighbour,
whereby he may the easier separate it, it is reckoned the
greatest injury that can be offered them; and it is really a
very dangerous way of eating, especially when people are very
hungry, therefore they are generally attended, during that
time, by several persons with clubs in their hands, in case
any should by chance swallow a piece too large for their
gullets, and it should stick therein—which, through their
greediness, often happened—and then one of those atten-
dants gave the party a very hearty blow with his cudgel in
the neck, by which means it was generally discharged either
up or down, and, in case it was not, then they repeated
the blow till it was. This did I often see, and have been
as often diverted with it.
About this time came Commodore Stewart, ambassador
to Mequinez, with full powers from his royal master to
treat with the Emperor for the so long desired redemption
of the poor English captives.
Here it will not be amiss to describe the exceeding
weight of misery which our fellow-countrymen undergo

factors in Europe are lenity and indulgence, compared to
what many worthy persons undergo in this modern Egypt;
even slavery at Tunis or Algiers is a state of repose and
felicity to that in the Morocco dominions. At daybreak
the guardians of the several dungeons, where the Christian
slaves are shut up at night, rouse them with curses and
blows to their work, which here is not repairing or rigging
of ships, but more laborious, as it consists in providing
materials for the Emperor's extravagant buildings,
stamping earth mixed with lime and water, in a wooden
box near three yards long and three feet deep, and of the
intended breadth of the wall. Their instrument for this
is a heavy wooden stamper. Others prepare and mix the
earth, or dig in quarries for lime stones ; others burn
them. Some are employed to carry large baskets of earth;
some drive waggons drawn by six bulls and two horses ;
and, after the toil of the day, these miserable carters
watch their cattle in the field at night, and in all weathers,
as their life must answer for any accident. The task of
many is to saw, cut, cement, and erect marble pillars, and
of such who are found qualified, to make gunpowder and
small arms; yet does not their skill procure them any
better treatment than those who, having only the use of
their limbs without any ingenuity, are set to the coarsest
works, as tending horses, sweeping stables, carrying
burthens, grinding with hand-mills. Some have also in
charge to manage the water-works, and inspect the aque-
ducts. In all these so different departments the ignorant
and artist are upon a level, very few instances excepted.

wearisome day, it frequently happens they are hurried
away to some filthy work in the night-time, with this call
in Spanish, “ Vamos a travacho cornutos," i.e., “Out to
work, you cuckolds," an appellation of the bitterest reproach
among the Moors, except "Thou son of a Christian.” But
a circumstance more affecting than all these rigours is
that men, created in the image of God, have been
harnessed in carts with mules and asses. Their lodgings
in the night are subterraneous dungeons, round, and about
five fathoms diameter, and three deep, going down by a
ladder of ropes, which is afterwards drawn up, and an iron
grate fastened in the mouth; and here they lay upon mats.
Neither has their fare anything more comfortable in it,
consisting only of a small platter of black barleymeal,
with a pittance of oil per day. This scantiness has put
several upon hazarding a leap from very high walls only
to get a few wild onions that grow in the Moors’ burying-
place. The slaves usual habit is a long coarse woollen
coat with a hood, which serves for a cap, shirt, coat, and
breeches, and four pair of pumps for a year and a half,
though lime and mortar, and their daily hard work, wears
them off their feet in half the time. It is moderately
computed that many Christian slaves have been suddenly
killed by Muley Ishmael and other emperors merely out
of wantonness, and sometimes finding fault with their
dispatch, or manner of working, of which they could have
no competent idea. If it be accounted an honour to be
the sovereign's slave, like some others, it is very burthen-
some, for they are not only harder worked when in health
than those of private persons, but much more neglected in
sickness—though of the care bestowed on the latter, it may
with great propriety be said that the remedy* is worse than

the disease. The only alleviation is, that the slaves are
allowed to make brandy, and the Jews are taxed with the
materials. This is owing to a notion infused into the
emperors, that the Europeans would lose all their in.
genuity and vigour without now and then a draught of
that inspiring liquor. May that notion ever obtain there !
But experience shows us that the frequent use of spirituous
liquors both enervates and stupefies. The Moors are ex-
tremely cautious and artful in purchasing slaves, and,
besides inveigling questions and cajolings, have many
methods and tokens to judge what ransom a slave will
yield, and accordingly will readily give some hundred
pounds where all promising appearances occur; but where
the greater ransom is expected the usage is the worst.
These exasperating sufferings have often prompted the
blaves to make some efforts for liberty, but they have
mostly terminated in miscarriages. Once a large dungeon
was. undermined, and great numbers in a fair way to
escape, but a Dutchman, breaking his leg' by a fall, and
crying out with the anguish, they were retaken, and put
to a torturing death for an example.
Commodore Stewart was conducted to Mequinez from
Tetuan by Hamet Ben Ally,* one of the Emperor's
Bashaws; in which embassy, the Commodore being a
very able, well-accomplished, courteous, and indefatigable
gentleman, notwithstanding his often meeting with very
great insults and manifest dangers, managed his point
80 well, that in six weeks, or thereabouts, he procured the
enlargement of all the English slaves (those under my
unhappy circumstances only excepted), in number three
hundred and one,t releasing them from their long servitude
* Hamet ben Ali ben Abdallahı.
Hit The actual number freed was 296. Of the 1,100 European slaves
at Mequinez, 300 were English, “not including nineteen who had
turned Moor."

and chains, and conducting them to Tetuan, where he
found shipping ready to transport them to their so long
desired homes, there being then more than six years
expired since they were first made prisoners, that is to
say, those taken with poor unhappy me, who you may
imagine could not be allowed to go with them, though I
most humbly intreated it by all the means I could devise,
all my solicitations being in vain, so that I was obliged
to content myself to effect my deliverance by private
escape when opportunity offered ; to which end the
ambassador gave me very friendly advice, together with
many other marks of his favour.
I might here fill up a great deal by way of the several
occurrences relating to the ambassador's entrance, be-
haviour, usage, and return to Teutan, and,* in short, many
other passages of moment, and which I very particularly
remember ; but as I am informed there is a book of it
already printed, I shall not go about in anywise to inter-
fere with it; Commodore Stewart being a gentleman of
so much good observance, that mine might only prove to
be a recital of it, or at least a dull tautology of the same
things; though I cannot again help saying, and which, no
doubt, in that report is omitted, that he in every point
behaved in so polite, most Christian-like, and majestic a
manner, as not to derogate from, or lessen the trust
reposed in him by his royal master, whose person and
dignity he was to represent, and which I heartily wish
had been so well performed by a certain gentlemant sent
to Mequinez on the same errand about four years before
him; then had it in all likelihood prevented many aching
hearts, and my poor uncle, with many other poor Christian
slaves (who during that interval died there), had probably
been still alive.

I being now become, as I have already said, one of the
Emperor's attendants, and always ready in obedience to
his commands, in receiving him bare-headed and bare-
footed at his entrance in, or at his going out of the palace,
I having my head shaved every eighth day for that purpose ;
and not only his guards treat him with this submissive
respect, but his whole court, consisting of his great officers
and alcaydes, assemble every morning about eight or nine
o'clock, all barefooted, to know if the Emperor has been
abroad (for if he keepsi within doors, there's no seeing
him, unless sent for), or if he's returned in a good humour,
which is well known by his very looks and motions, and
sometimes by the colour of the habit he wears, yellow
being observed to be his killing colour; from all which
they calculate whether they may hope to live twenty-four
hours longer.
If the Emperor comes out, their necks are all held out,
their eyes fixed on the ground; and after this manner the
croucbing creatures pay their homage, and when they
approach him, fall down and kiss the ground at his
horse's feet. If he speaks, some swear by their god what
he says is true ; others, at every pause he makes, cry out,
“God lengthen thy days, my lord; God bless thy life ; ”
which once occasioned an accidental jest, for he was
saying, “ May I be called the greatest of liars, if I have
not always conceived a great esteem for the English;" and
making a little stop at the word “liars," his officious court
cried out, “Yes, by G-d it's true, my lord!”
If he comes not out, he sometimes sends for some of
them; at other times he has the door opened, and orders
them all to pass muster, and they go one by one cringing
by the door. If he only goes a little way out of the gate
of his palace, they follow him on foot through the dirt;
and he is a great man, and esteemed a great favourite,

who advances as far as his stirrup; and if he has occasion
to send a message, though never so trivial, the best of
them are ready to run, without respect to age, rank, or
favour (even his favourite Hameda used to make his
court this way), and return bespattered up to their eyes, at
least all over their white drawers, and other garments
which are white; nay, I have heard that Hamet Ben
Haddu Attar (who was ambassador in England in King
Charles the Second's time) was once surprised without his
shoes, walking barefoot in a great deal of dirt by his
horse ; and without regard to his age, or the pretence he
had to his favour, was sent to the furthest part of the
town in that condition.
During all intervals from such my attendance, I was,
together with the rest of the guards, generally exercised
in shooting with a single ball at a mark, which was
generally a red cap set on the top of a high piece of
ground, distant about two hundred paces; at which we all,
to the number of nine hundred, and something more, fired
together at the word of command, the Emperor so ordering
it, thereby to make us the more expert, ready and dex-
terous, in case of any warlike action, whereto we might
happen to be suddenly called; though for my part, I
could never see who that person was that hit the mark,
if hit at all. It was, I think, impossible for any to
determine, though I must acknowledge it to be a very
good way in training up soldiers to their making of close
vollies ; yet, indeed, I saw at other places these firings
single, and where the party was so lucky to hit it, he did
not fail of a suitable reward.
You may now perhaps imagine, that as I was altogether
at the Emperor's command, I was quite excluded the
sight and favour of the Queen; which I was not, often
receiving very valuable acknowledgments thereof, even

from her own hands, and certainly through her means I
hitherto fared the better with the Emperor. For, in short,
she thought she could not oblige me enough, and therefore
was over solicitous in an affair which I had much rather
should have been let alone, and such as I thought she
would never have urged or consented with herself to have
put upon me, it being quite the reverse of my inclinations ;
yet did she urge it, and obtain it, and was, no doubt, some
time in bringing it about with the Emperor.
One day, the Emperor being on the merry pin, ordered
to be brought before him eight hundred young men, and
soon after as many young women, who also instantly
appearing (as being, no doubt, before ordered to be ready
at hand), he told the men, that as he had on several
occasions observed their readiness and dexterity in obeying
him, he would therefore, as in some part of recompense,
give every one of them a wife; and which, indeed, he
soon did, by giving some by his own hand (a very great
condescension), and to others by the beckouing of his head,
and the cast of his eye, where they should fix. After
they were all coupled and departed, I was also called forth,
and bid to look at eight black women standing there, and
to take one of them for a wife. At which sudden command,
I (being not a little confounded, as not at all liking their
colour) immediately bowing twice, falling to the ground
and kissing it, and after that the Emperor's foot (which
is the custom of those who desire to be heard, as well
as a very great favour and condescension to be permitted
to do), humbly intreated him, if, in case I must have a
wife, that he would be graciously pleased to give me one
of my own colour. Then, forth with sending them off, he
ordered to be brought forth seven others, who all proved
to be Mulattoes; at which I again bowed to the ground,
still entreating him to give me one of my own colour; and

then he ordered them also to depart, and sent for a single
woman, full dressed, and who in a very little time appeared,
with two young blacks attending her, she being, no doubt,
the same he and the Queen had before particularly
designed for me. I being forth with ordered to take her
by the hand and lead her off, which she holding out to me,
I perceived it to be black also, as soon after I did her feet;
at which I started back, like one in a very great surprise,
and being asked what was the matter, I answered him as
before ; when he smiling, ordered me to lift up her veil
(it being the custom of the country for women to go veiled)
and look at her face; which I readily obeying, found her
to be of a very agreeable complexion, the old rascal crying
out, in a very pleasing way, in the Spanish language,
“Bono ! Bono ! ” which signifies, "Good! Good !" order-
ing me a second time to take her by the hand, lead her
off, and keep her safe.
This artificial blackness of her hands and feet was laid
on by a certain grass, first made into powder and mixed
with water, alum, and the juice of lemons, and is called
el bhenna, being brought from the river Draugh, about
ten days' journey from Mequinez, and still further from
Taffilet, and several other places.*
At our coming out of the palace, we found her father,
mother, sister, and sister's husband, ready to receive us
(the latter being a man of very considerable authority, as
having under his command one thousand five hundred
young men, who go under the name of “Kiadrossams,"
being all the Emperor's brothers-in-law, and are gener-
ally at his call in the palace), and received us very
courteously indeed, desiring me, as it was the Em-
peror's pleasure to give me his sister, that I would
always behave to her as a loving husband, eo far as she

deserved, and at the same time exhorting her no less in
her duty to me. This we both readily promised to each
other, and which was indeed by both of us as faithfully
performed. Their next request being our acceptance of an
apartment (as having none of our own) in this our
brother-in-law's house, till such time as we were provided
with one of our own which we as readily came into, and
together with the old gentry went with them, though we
were for the first night lodged in separate lodgings,
as I suppose were the rest, being all first obliged to
appear again the next day at the palace, there to receive a
certificate from the secretary as a ratification or finishing
stroke, and each couple fifteen ducats, each ducat 6s. 8d.,
making in all just £5 in English money, two thirds for the
man and one for the woman, as the Emperor's bounty on
such-like occasions, before our marriage could be com-
pleted. Which being paid, and our certificates delivered,
each man paying for them (as the secretary's fee) sixteen
blankeels (pieces of money of about twopence in value each),
we were all dismissed to make merry with our friends, and
celebrate our nuptials. As I and my spouse were well
accounted of amongst the better sort, we did not want for
plenty of wedding guests, nor they for plenty of good
eatables, I having provided, at my own charge (over and
above that of my brother-in-law's) a fat bullock, four
sheep, two dozen of large fowls, twelve dozen of young
pigeons, 150lb, weight of fine flour, and 50lb. of butter,
with a sufficient store of honey, spices, &c. All which, our
wedding holding three days, was clearly despatched with
a great deal of mirth, and friendly satisfaction. Yet was
it the soberest wedding you ever saw, for we had not,
among all this great company, one intoxicated person,
though they had all as much liquor as they would drink;
þut such, indeed, as might sooner break their bellies than

operate in their noddles, being only water ; wine being by
their grand impostor, and great prophet, Mahomet, alto-
gether forbidden. And though it is death by his law for
any person discovered in drinking it, yet it is by some
privately drunk, even to excess, there being great store,
and very good in Barbary, besides what they catch from
other countries.
This short way of marrying his guards the Emperor
frequently put in practice, by often ordering great numbers
of people before him, whom he marries without any more
ceremony than pointing to the man and woman and
saying, “Hadi yi houd Hadi,” that is to say, “That take
That;"upon which the loving pair join together, and march
off as firmly noosed as if they had been married by a Pope.
He always yokes his best complexioned subjects to a black
helpmate, and the fair lady must take up with a negro.
But the Moors in general, who are not married by the
Emperor's command, use a great deal of ceremony about it.
When a man wants a wife, either his mother or some of
his female relations must go a-courting for him (custom
not permitting the man to visit the woman beforehand),
and when the bargain is made, which is done before the
Cady, or justice, the bride is to keep within for eight days,
her friends coming to rejoice with her every day, and a
Talb, or priest, also visiting her, and discoursing on that
holy state ; they pin the basket with a religious hymn
appointed for that purpose. The husband, with his
friends, repeats the same ceremonies for five days before
the consummation in a house which he has, or must take
to bring his wife to. The last day the bride is put into a
cage, covered with a fine linen cloth, and carried on men s
shoulders to the house of her intended husband ; her
friends, relations, and music going before. Her brother
(if she has one) leads her into the house, where a room is

appointed for her and the women; the man remains also
in his room with his friends. When the evening ap-
proaches they are let loose by the company, and the
bridegroom goes to his wife's apartment, where he finds
her alone, sitting on a cushion of silk, velvet, or such fine
things as they can borrow (if they have them not of their
own): underneath there's a silk quilt; before her stands a
little table, about a foot high, with two wax candles upon
it. Upon her head she has a black silk scarf, tied in a
knot, the ends hanging on the ground behind her; her
shift is made with large sleeves like the men's, and long
enough to hang behind her like a train. Her vest is of silk,
or velvet, buttoned close to her hands, and reaches to the
middle of her leg, adorned with lace at the hands, and all
over the breast. She has the same linen drawers described
in the women's dress, and collars of pearl or fine stones,
and (if she can get them) of lions' or eagles' claws tipt with
silver; in her ears she has great rings of gold or silver,
and the same about her wrists and ankles, sometimes set
with stones. Her slippers have thick soles made of cork,
covered with gilt leather, and edged with the same, which
is a mark of greatness among them, the Emperor and some
few more wearing them. Her cheeks are painted with
cochineal, which colours yellow at first, but being rubbed
presently turns red ; with this they make one great round
spot on each cheek. Their eyebrows are painted black,
and continued quite round their temples, like a pair of
whiskers. They also make some small black spots, in
imitation of patches, near their nose and lips, a black snip
on the end of their nose, and a black stroke, the breadth of
a straw from their chin, reaching down below the pit of
their stomach, and how much lower I can't tell, for there
they begin to be covered ; they paint their eyelids and the
sides of them with a black powder called Alchol [or anti-

mony], putting some of the same into their eyes with a little
stick; the palms of their hands are all blacked, and from
the top of their thumbs round the fleshy part is a black
stroke, and one from the end of each finger to the palm ;
their nails are dyed yellow; they also have many fine
scrawls of black on the top of their feet, and their toe-nails
are likewise dyed yellow.
Thus beautified, the bride sits behind the table mentioned
before, with two wax candles upon it, holding her hands up
the height of her face, with the palms turned towards her,
about a foot distance from each other, and as much from
her face, upon which she is to look, and not on her hus-
band. After this follows some other customs such as are
still practised to a certain extent in Spain, though they
do not call for minute description here. It need only be
remarked that the bridegroom is obliged to stay at home
for seven days, and the bride a whole year, who is kept ever
after so close from the rest of mankind, that not even her
father or brother can have the privilege of a visit unless
her husband is present.
All the women paint after the manner before mentioned
at their public meetings; they are extremely handsome,
and bred up with the greatest care imaginable in relation to
their modesty; the fattest and biggest are most admired,
for which reason they cram themselves against marriage
with a food called Zummith; it is a compound of flour,
honey, and spices, made into little loaves for that purpose.
And now I am soon about to enter from the sports of
Venus into the field of Mars, though indeed I had the com-
pany of my wife by intervals for some years after ; for our
wedding being ended, I was on the fourth day, or day
after, ordered to prepare myself for my departure to a
garrison in the province of Tamnsnah,* about six days'

journey from Mequinez, whence (after taking leave of our
friends) I and my wife set out the same day, accompanied
by six hundred of those who were so lately married with
us, three hundred of them being put under my command,
and the other three hundred under the command of Musa,
or Moses Belearge, a Spaniard, they likewise taking with
them their wives. These six hundred men were of different
nations, French, Spaniards, Portuguese, and Italians, but
not an Englishman amongst them, except myself. Bashaw
Hammo Triffoe (half Spaniard and half Moor), Commander
in Chief of that province, with two thousand men, went
also with us, and being obliged to take with us a priest,
the Emperor commanded me to find one, if possible, who
was both blind and deaf, that if in case any of us should
happen to take a cup of wine (as being used thereto in our
own respective countries, and therefore might the sooner
do so in his) he might not be capable of taking notice of
it; for, added he, “though I will by no means encourage
it, yet should I much rather be excused from receiving any
complaints of that nature, whereby to give them any
uneasiness.” Though I made the best inquiry I could, yet
I could by no means meet with such a one; therefore I
recommended to him my wife's uncle, a seeming honest
man, and one who was approved of by the Emperor, and
by us as joyfully received. Then after being strictly charged
to reside the first month at the castle of Tamnsnoe,* and
the next at Stant, so as each garrison might have him by
turns every other month, he cheerfully travelled on with us;
and though he could both see and hear very well, yet was
I under no apprehension of his giving the Emperor any
uneasiness on our account, I having before seen him to
drink wine in a plentiful manner.

well mounted, the men on fine horses, which, as they are
so famous for goodness, it will not be improper to say
something of the Moors' method of managing them. The
Moors take a great deal of pride in their horses, and order
them after a very different manner from us ; they back
them generally at two years old, and shear their manes
and tails till they come to six, thinking that makes them
strong. At grass they tie sometimes the two fore feet
together, at other times a fore foot and a hinder one. In
their stables they have two iron pins drove into the ground,
one before, and the other behind them, at the distance
of about three feet from their legs, which are fastened
together with ropes, like our traves, with which we teach
horses to pace, but being short, they draw their legs
together under their bellies, and two ropes come from their
hind and fore feet, which are so tied to these pins that they
cannot stir above one foot backwards or forwards. Their
collar is also made fast to the pin before them, which has
a ring for that purpose ; under them is a hole covered with
pieces of timber to receive their water, and a little on one
side a bed of sand, or sawdust, for them to lie upon. They
have no mangers, but eat their straw or grass off the ground.
All their horses eat grass in April and May, and, if it be
a good year, great part of March ; at other times they eat
straw instead of hay; their barley is given them in a
woollen bag, put over their heads. They are never dressed,
nor their manes or tails combed, but when dirty are
carried to the next running water and washed, and if they
design to have them look fine, they use a little soap. Some
will take it amiss that you touch a horse with the palm of
your hand to stroke him, and say there is venom in that
part which is hurtful to horses. They never crop their
tails or ears, nor geld them, for they like no maimed
creatures but eunuchs for other reasons.

They have one sort which they call “ Noble Horses,”
who bow their heads about at the approach of a man.
Their love is so great for horses, that not only they are one
of the three things for which the Moors have a proverb, as
most esteemed, viz., “A horse, a woman, and a book," but
they keep even the genealogies of them for two or three
hundred years, and are nice in distinguishing the true from
the mixed generations. They have a base way of shoeing
them, cutting off the fore part of the hoof, and forming the
shoe into a triangular shape, with the two points almost
meeting at the heel, which points are made very thin, and
after the shoe is fastened with three nails on each side are
beaten as flat to the hoof as possible; but some time ago
the Emperor issued out an order that upon pain of death
all horses should be shoed with round shoes, a certain Turk
having persuaded him that was the best way.
They are not subject to distempers, and the Moors (as
Windus puts it) know not what you mean by a farsey
or glander, nor have I ever seen a spavin or mullender.
As for the Berebbers in the mountains, they never shoe
their horses; and their feet are certainly firmer than ours,
for a horse went to Tetuan from the camp, and came back
the next day, without a shoe, which is fifty miles, and not-
withstanding he was forced to cross a mountain full of
rocks going and coming, not being able to pass the low way
for a river, it was not perceived he had the least crack in
his hoof, or made any complaint of his feet. Their horses
live to a great age, and are very fresh at fourteen or fifteen,
the reason of which seems to be their going so gently on
the road, where they seldom are put out of a foot-pace, but
when they exercise the lance they make them bestir them.

river Bate, * about five leagues, the second day to the
castle Cassabjibbad, t the third to an old ruined castle
called Phinseera, 1 and the fourth to the walls of Sallee,
Hammo Triffe and his people encamping and remaining
without three days, during which us new-married people
had the liberty to go into the town, were lodged there, and
most sumptuously feasted by the Emperor's order, as
indeed were the Bashaw's men in their tents, there being
great quantities of provision of all sorts carried out for that
purpose.
The next day we again set forward, and got to Sharrot,
all the way being very woody, and plentifully stored with
wild-hogs, and of them we killed some hundreds, which,
perhaps (as their flesh is by the Mahometan law forbidden),
may be imagined was either for pastime or antipathy, yet
had we another reason, viz., by way of revenge on a very
large boar assaulting the Bashaw, and killing his horse
under him, though the beast instantly lost his own life by
it. These boars, and especially those of a middle age, are
very dangerous creatures, having very long tusks as keen
as knives, and which, with the very great force and fury they
execute their intention with, will rip up anything as soon.
The tusks of the old ones generally turn up like a ram's
horn, so that they cannot so well bring them to do mischief
suitable to their rage. Here are also great plenty of lions,
tigers, wolves, &c. However, we saw none of them that
day.
Sharrot is a river discharging itself into the sea about
seven leagues to the southward of Sallee, and plentifully
stored with many sorts of very excellent fish ; and fording

stores of corn, which the Moors have a way of preserving
without damage for a hundred years together by putting it
into pits, plastered within and over the mouth when they
are full. The next day, at ten in the forenoon, we got to
the castle of Tamnsnah, where I, by the Bashaw's order,
immediately entered with two hundred of my men and our
wires, the old garrison marching out to make room for us ;
and my other hundred men were sent with their wives to
Bevash,* another castle about three days' march from
thence, to be commanded by a deputy of my own appoint-
ment.
At my entrance into the castle, I found all things pretty
much in disorder, there being almost a general want of
everything, for what the old people had they carried (or
at least most of it) with them. However, these wants
were, by the Bashaw's diligence (he remaining encamped
without sixteen days), very plentifully supplied by sending
us in provisions and stores enough for our subsistence for
six months. This being done, he rose with his small
army and departed, as I was informed, for Stant, a garri-
son distant from thence about twelve leagues; where after
staying also about sixteen days, and settling Belearge
and his men therein for the better security of the
Emperor's stores of grain laid up there, he departed for
the City of Morocco, of which he was the governor.
Now have I and my comrades for some time nothing to
do but to contrive ways and means how to divert ourselves,
which we did after the best manner we could devise, living

years, though I was several times, with some part of my
men, ordered thence for the space of six or seven months,

My first absence was about three months after my first
arrival, when I received a peremptory command from the
Bashaw to attend him with two hundred of my men as
soon as possible I could, and to leave my other hundred to.
secure my several garrisons; in pursuance of which order
I drew out one hundred and fifty of my men, leaving the
other fifty to take care of the garrison and the women,
and immediately departed, and got that day to the castle
of Stant, where I found my old friend Belearge was with
a like number gone before me. The second day I marched
to Geefaar, an old ruined castle, though well stored with
water and many other necessary refreshments, both for
man and horse; and the third day, about noon, to my
other castle of Broash, where I directly entered, and
found my other hundred men and their wives very well,
who received us very courteously; and I forthwith drawing
out fifty of them, which made my number complete,
proceeded, and got that evening to Cedeboazzo, in the
province of Talgror,* and the next to the river Tensift,
whence very early the next morning, the Bashaw meeting
us with good store of provision on the road, we were by
him conducted, with fine music playing before us, in great
pomp to the walls of Morocco, where I found my old
friend Belearge with the rest of the Bashaw's army,
encamped without the walls of the city, though as we
had before, by the Emperor's orders, liberty to go into
the town of Sallee, so were we now ordered to march
together into Morocco, and there treated after like manner,
with this difference only, the former being at the charge of
the Emperor and this at that of the inhabitants, as indeed
was also that of the whole camp.
The city of Morocco is very well situated, and reckoned
to be twelve miles in compass. It is said to have bad

formerly a hundred thousand houses in it, but since the
kings of Morocco have removed their court from thence
to Mequinez, it is greatly decreased, but its palace or
castle is the stateliest of any in Africa, it being of a
prodigious extent, some of the rooms of which have large
fish-ponds in them, and the fishes may be seen swimming
in the looking-glasses, with which the ceilings are covered.
There are likewise in this city very fine gardens, and many
ancient and well-built mosques. The famous aqueducts,
which bring water to it from above forty miles, are a
stupendous work.
We rested seven days at Morocco, being ordered on the
eighth early to march out and join the army; when we all
rose, and marched that day to the river of Wadden
Enfeech, distance seven leagues, where we rested that
night, and the next day to Mesmeath,* at the foot of a
very high mountain, and where (on account of the inhabi-
tants there and thereabout not having for some time back
performed the payments of their wonted tribute) we
settled our camp and rested fifteen days, during wbich,
notwithstanding they had before our coming refused to
pay it, yet did many of them at our approach, and
especially Tolbtrammet Mesmeasoy,t the head and chief
of that province, come to meet us; and declaring to the
Bashaw, after the most solemn manner, that he had no
hand in the rebellion, as he understood had been basely
and maliciously rumoured of him, the rebels having made
use of his name for the better carrying on their wicked
designs, he entreated that he would believe him innocent,
as in reality he said he was, having never made the least
advance that way, but, on the contrary, had done all in
his power to prevent it, even to the extreme hazard of his
life; therefore desired he would not look upon him as an

enemy to his country, but accept of the few presents he
had brought him with as good a grace as they were offered
by him with good will, and in all due obedience, being in
truth those of one of the most loyal, most dutiful and
obedient of his Majesty's subjects. These presents being
somewhat considerable, as four very fine horses and
furnitures, several Zurbees, * or Turbants, with a handsome
purse of gold to usher them in, the Bashaw had not the
heart to refuse. He likewise entreated the Bashaw to
suffer him to send in provision for the army, which was
also complied with, and plentifully performed during our
stay there, with everything else in conformity to our
demands. After a few days we rose and marched thence
Beven leagues further, along the foot of the mountain, and
pitched our tents in the evening at Emsoeda,t keeping
ourselves under arms for the first part of the night in
great silence, and about midnight (drawing out six thou-
sand men, our whole number being eight thousand, leaving
the other two thousand to feed and keep safe our horses)
we marched on foot up the mountain, where we had an
account many of the malcontents had sheltered them-
selves ; which being very woody, steep, and craggy, our
horses could have been of no service to us, but rather a
hinderance, and would have been a means of exposing us
to be taken off separate from each other by the enemy in
their lurking places before we could discover them.

silence and undiscovered, till sunrising. Then we saw
several herdsmen and shepherds coming forth with their
cattle, they being always at night secured within from the
frequent incursions of the mountaineer Moors, and for
fear of lions, tigers, wolves, and jackals, the sheep
standing in as much danger from the latter as they do
from the wolves, who are, in their voracious nature,
sufficiently imitated by the jackals, of which there are
vast numbers in Barbary. I had heard by several

subtle creatures, and served only for procuring prey for
the lion, by hunting before him, thereby to keep them-
selves in his favour and from his paws, yet have I often
seen them lay hold of an innocent sheep, and in a moment
tear him in pieces, and have very often shot them for their
pains and eat of them into the bargain.
On these herdsmen’s discovering us they instantly
alarmed the castle, and no doubt to the great surprise of
those within, more especially when they saw us so near
their walls, surrounding them so as they might not in any
probability hope for escape ; yet did they prepare for
defence, and fired upon us with small arms very briskly,
but cannon they had none, no more than ourselves, killing
in all but three of our men, we having got ourselves so
close under their walls that they could not bring their shot
to bear on us, we calling to them, “That in case they any
longer resisted, and did not directly deliver up the garrison
into our hands, we would put every one of them to the
sword.” To which we not receiving such satisfactory
answer as we had expected, and having by that time
almost finished three several mines at the foot of the
castle wall, and of which those within were not the least
apprised, we fired them all about one and the same time,
making such breaches as were wide enough for twenty
men to enter in a breast at each, and immediately began
to pour them in. Upon which the rebels, being in a terrible
fright, submitted to mercy, crying out for quarter, and
humbly on their knees imploring pardon for themselves
and families, assuring us that, on receiving clemency, they
would make their future behaviour appear to be no less
deserving of the Emperor's favour than those of the most
observant of his subjects, alleging that they had been led
astray by those higher up in the mountain, and whom,
had they not come into seeming measures with, would

then have destroyed them to a man; therefore, said they,
"revenge yourselves on them, and you shall soon see that
we will not be backward with our assistance to subdue
them." Notwithstanding this submission we killed eighteen
of them, and amongst them the governor's brother and
his brother's son, whose heads were cut off by the
Bashaw's own hand, the latter being first obliged to
drag that of his father's round the army by a rope fixed
about his neck and to suffer a most cruel scourging from
most of them, and then both their heads, with the edge
of the Bashaw's sword, were set upon the castle gate;
at which the governor, as having five sons of his own,
was no doubt in a most grievous agony, and kept still
on his knees, desiring the Bashaw to believe him innocent,
and by horrid and repeated imprecations of it declaring
that he had no hand in that rebellion, and that his being
there was more by compulsion than inclination, and that
he hoped that he could not be accounted so stupid as not
to suppose the Emperor would soon make reprisals on
them, and that notwithstanding he had been so unhappy
to father the fictitious name of governor, &c. Yet he most
bumbly hoped that the Bashaw would believe him and
permit him to use his utmost efforts by way of reducing
the remainder of the rebels who had compelled him to so
undutiful a behaviour, and whereby he might not only in
some measure make his royal master compensation, but
our future proceedings by far less hazardous, for that he
would directly send his messengers to acquaint them with
his own present condition; and in case they any longer
persisted in their rebellion and did not directly come in,
and with themi bring in to him their respective tributes, he
was ready to spend the last drop of his blood in subduing
them. Then the Bashaw ordered him off his knees, and
after some short private conference their countenances

seemed to be on both sides more calm and serene ; and a.
general pardon was, to the general joy, proclaimed. On:
which many came in soon after with their presents and,
arrears, as indeed did all in those parts, saving only four
little towns, which might contain in them about four
thousand men that bore arms, lying on or very nigh the:
top of the mountain, then covered with snow and very
difficult to get up, which retarded our march sixteen days ;
when there falling a very great flood of rain, which
washing the snow down the mountain, so that there
appeared some likelihood of our being able to get up it,
though with great difficulty, we departed from the castle
of Ehiah Embelide, taking with us the governor, and
marched (or rather indeed climbed) up as fast as we could,
and got to the first of the towns that evening, very
sufficiently tired. However, we soon entered, but found it
quite desolate, the inhabitants having all retired into the
next town, at about half a mile's distance; which, as.
their neighbours were joined with them, was no doubt of
more strength and security; but the darkness of the
night coming on apace, the Bashaw was determined not
to attack them till the next morning. However, we
carried off all we could find here, set the village on fire,
and retired to some distance, where we settled for the
night in an open camp. About suprising we took one of
their spies, who had that night been out upon the scout,
and brought him before the Bashaw, who, after threaten-
ing to cut off his head, told him that in case he would go
directly into the town, and on his honour immediately
return to him with their answer if they intended to deliver
up the town without resistance or not, he would give him
- his life. On which, and the late governor of Ehiah
Embelide's also vouching for the Bashaw's performance:
of his promise, he went in and soon returned with an

answer to his message, and to challenge his pardon,
telling them that the inhabitants would not on any terms
surrender, but were resolved to fight it out, even to the
last man. Which (said he) they told me they had before
signified to the governor of Ehiab Embelide, by way of
answer to his message relating to their coming in with
their arrears ; that he was a dastardly fellow, and if he
should happen to fall into their hands he should be the
first sacrifice to their rage. The Bashaw finding what he
had to trust to, ordered us directly to cut down and bind
up a great quantity of large faggots or bavins, which, as
I was then altogether a novice in affairs of that nature,
I really thought were for no other use" than burning.
However, I soon saw my ignorance therein, and thought
them to be a tolerable safeguard from the shot of the
enemy, every other man taking one of them, and carrying
it lengthways before him and his comrade, who was close
at his back. Advancing after this manner till we got
within half musket shot of their walls, and notwithstand-
ing they kept a continual firing from the walls of the
town upon us, yet did we not receive any damage thereby,
but intrenched ourselves breast high in a very little time.
About a dozen of our best miners and an engineer
advanced with their pick-axes and other necessary im-
plements even close under their walls, and immediately
fell to work to undermine them. When they were to be
relieved they retired going backward, carrying their bavins
next their faces; and a fresh set, on the contrary, advanc-
ing, took their post. In the meantime the rest of us kept
a continual fire, so that the enemy did not so much as
dare to peep at those places of the walls where our people
were carrying on their mines at the bottom. And though
we were three days before we had finished them to our
engineers’ minds (there being in all three), yet did they

never attempt once to sally forth, but suffered us to blow
them up to our satisfaction, making such breaches as we
entered all our men at in a very little time; and in three
hours (during which there was on both sides very bloody
work) we put all of them (the women and children under
ten years of age, and the man that carried in the Bashaw's
message only excepted) to the sword. Then, after plundering
and demolishing the houses and walls, and setting all we
could not carry away on fire, we sat down before one of the
other two, which we found to be also joined by their
neighbours, and offering the like resistance, but they did
not resist longer than three hours. Notwithstanding, we
did not spare them, but cut them off also to a man; and
after plundering, demolishing, and burning this and their
other deserted town, which was the last of the four, we,
with our plunder of all kinds, as money, corn, butter,
honey, raisins, almonds, and everything else of value,
got to our trenches, where we soon found our error in so
hastily destroying their houses; for notwithstanding the
weather was extreme cold, yet we were obliged, on account
of our wounded men, to remain there for three days, and
then marched down to the castle of Ehiah Embelide,
having with us all their cattle, and our wounded men
carried in hand barrows. We rested there three days,
looking over our booty and receiving several others of the
rebels who came in there. We then fell down into our
camp, which we found unmolested, having still with us
all the wounded and several surgeons to attend them;
and here we rested eighteen days, during which many
others came in to us with their respective presents and
arrears. We rose hence with our whole army, and
marched along the foot of the mountain for about seven
leagues, to Foumalcarroe,* a very large house in nature

of a castle, situate on a river commanded by Kiadmonsor
Boalroaeh, * who was at our approach ready with his
presents and arrears, and received us in a most friendly
manner, declaring he had no hand in the rebellion, main-
taining our army three days, and bringing us in every
day twice as much provision as we could all eat, and such
part of the flesh as we could not then dispense with, was,

We having some reasons to believe him innocent, over and
above this his so bountiful hospitality, on promise of his
future obedience and admittance 'the Bashaw pardoned
him, and marched on to Eminstanud,t a castle about two
leagues distant from thence; where having received a
like satisfaction, he went on to Mentugoe, i seven leagues
farther, where they also came in to him with their
presents and arrears; and here we again pitched our
tents and settled our camp for six weeks, during which
time all that province, some by foul and others by fair
means, came in also, and followed the example of their
neighbours. From Montugoe we marched to Itawaddeel,
one day's journey; and thence the next day to Sesagossulee, ||
a very high mountain; the next to Tammanert, subduing
all as we went: settling our camp here till all were like-
wise brought under obedience, we having first killed vast
numbers of them, and before our departure thence hung
up at least six hundred heads as a future terror. Here
turning back, we, after three days' march of about seven
leagues a day, got to Shadamah, a very large plentiful
province, where we continued till all were in like manner,

through like means, brought under the Emperor's subjec-
tion; which was the last and finishing stroke of this our
so long and dangerous expedition, in which we lost at the
least fifteen hundred of our men, and amongst them sixty
of my small number; myself, I thank God (though I had my
clothes shot through in several places), escaping unwounded.
We now began our march for Morocco, where we safely
arrived at the end of four days, having with us all our
- baggage, the greatest part of our booty, and three of the
chief men out of every province to be carried with us to
Mequinez, to give an account to the Emperor of their
behaviour in the late rebellion, the Bashaw and the
remains of his people encamping again without the walls
of the city, Belearge and myself, with the remains of
ours, being again ordered to march in; and we were by
the citizens most courteously entertained, selling our
shares of the booty, viz. bullocks and sheep in vast
numbers, for what any would give us ; I having myself,
with several others in partnership, sold there and at
several other places before on the road, four hundred
sheep for so small a price as a blankeel each (which is
twopence), and thought ourselves well off; for what could
we have done with them, being obliged to take that or
nothing ; besides, we were glad at any rate to get rid of
the very great trouble of driving them.
Now am I again in the city of Morocco, of which I do
not doubt but it may be expected that I should give a
particular description and an account of all its curiosities;
which I could readily, and would as willingly do, did I not
think it altogether inconsistent with my main point, and
would enlarge my history to very little purpose, by only
repeating what has been, without doubt, before made
public. Therefore I shall, by way of digression, mention
only two of the most agreeable curiosities which my own

fancy was struck with, the one within and the other
without the walls, and refer my readers for the rest to the
several books already printed ; and first of that within the
walls, which was four golden globes of a large size and
value, fixed on the top of the tower of the Emperor's palace,
and which, according to common fame, were set up many
hundred years ago on the following occasion.
Lulla Oudah,* daughter and widow to two of their
ancient Emperors, happened one day to see in a woman's
basket some very tempting peaches, and being at the same
time with child, she took one of them, and after biting off
& small part of it, and putting the remainder into the
basket again, she went away, saying, “She had but just
nicked the time;" of which some of the bystanders taking
notice and pondering thereon, it soon came into their
minds that it must be very near the time of the commence-
ment of their Ramadam, which is a very strict fast they
observe every twelfth moon; and during which, if any are
known to eat or drink from an hour before the breaking
of the day till the appearance of the stars, it is death by
their law; and they are not only obliged to abstain from
all manner of food, but likewise from smoking, washing
their mouths, taking snuff, smelling perfumes, or con-
versing with women.
Those who are obliged to travel may drink a little water;
and such as are sick may borrow a few days of their
prophet; but they must and do repay punctually, when
they recover strength. In the towns they run about the
streets and wake all those people they think are asleep,
that they may eat and so be the better able to support
themselves in the day; they rise three or four times in the
night, and sleep again. Such as are libertine, and used
to drink wine, abstain from it at this time.

It is usual in the towns every evening, when the fast
of that day is ended, for a trumpet to be sounded from the
castle, to give notice of it; before which time it is pleasant
to see the posture of the Moors, one holding a pipe ready
filled, while he impatiently expects the sound of the
trumpet; another with a dish of Cuscassoo before him,
ready to run his hand in ; some got close to the fountains,
to be the first that shall drink. On the eve of their Lent
they make great rejoicing, shouting and repeating the
name of God, and watch for the appearance of the moon,
at which they fire their muskets, then fall to saying their
prayers, the Emperor himself sometimes at their head ;
who, to persuade the people of his great regard for religion,
keeps this fast four months every year ; but they are
obliged to observe it only during that one moon.
The poor longing queen was, by a due inquiry into the
moon's age, found to bave transgressed in it by three hours,
and immediate sentence was passed upon her, which put
her under a grievous agony, as not knowing (though she
was exceeding rich) how to get off ; though at the last (on
her promising to set up those balls, and to build four
several bridges over two very rapid rivers, viz., three on
Murbia,* and one on 'Wadlabbid, t wherein abundance of
people had been before drowned, in their attempting to
cross over) she obtained a pardon; and these promises
were in her lifetime accordingly performed, together with
several large buildings, and donations for schools, alms-
houses, &c., over and above her very extraordinary and
chargeable obligation.
These four globes are, by computation, seven hundred
pounds, Barbary weight, each pound consisting of twenty-
four ounces, which make in all 1,050 pounds English ; and
frequent attempts had been made to take them away, but

without success ; for, as the notion ran, any attempting it
were soon glad to desist from it, they being affrightened,
and especially at their near approach to them, in a very
strange and surprising manner, and seized with an extra-
ordinary faintness and trembling, hearing at the same
time a great rumbling noise, like as if the whole fabric
was tumbling down about their ears, so that, in great
confusion, they all returned faster than they advanced.
This did I often hear, yet had I a very strong itching
to try the truth of it; and to gratify my curiosity, I one
night (having before communicated my intentions to two
of my men, and persuaded them to go with me, and
provided myself with candles, flint, steel, and tinder)
entered the foot of the tower, lighted my candles, and
advanced with my comrades close at my heels till I had
gained at least two-thirds of the height, I still going on.
Then really, to my seeming, I both felt and heard such a
dismal rumbling noise and shaking of the tower (my lights
at that very instant quite going out), as I thought far
surpassed that of common fame. Yet was I resolved to
proceed, and called to my comrades to be of good courage,
but having no answer from them, I soon found they had
left me in the lurch ; upon which, falling into a very great
sweat, I went back also, and found them at the bottom in
a terrible condition. And so ended my mad project, and
which was, I think, a very mad one indeed, for had I
obtained. the globes, in what could it have bettered
my deplorable condition, being always obliged to follow
the Emperor's pleasure, and with whom it was a most
sufficient crime to be rich. And so much for my foolish
attempt on the golden globes.*
What I was most delighted with, without the walls of
Morocco, was a most curious and spacious garden for the

king's pleasure, when he came to that city, it being by far
the finest of all I had ever seen before, being kept in the
most exquisite manner, as to its curious and regular walks
and arbours, and laid out with large collections of most
kinds of fruits and flowers, the fruit trees being very large,
and dressed and pruned in a very elegant manner; so
that their wood, and especially that of the orange trees,
was always in a prosperous condition, almost ever green,
blooming and bearing fruit. In this garden I saw the
trunk of an old tree (which I was told was that of a very
large orange tree), with great spreading branches, which,
when in its prosperity, was the death of Muley Archid,
the Emperor's brother (who, about seven years before,
killed Muley Em Hamet, his elder brother, with his own
hand, to make way for himself to the Empire). He being
one day in his garden on horseback, and his horse running
suddenly out with him, so that he could by no means stop
him, carried him under this tree, in a moment appearing
on the other side without his rider; and notwithstanding
the quick approach of his attendants, they found him
quite dead, hanging by his head in a forked limb. On
which account there was, no doubt, no little hurry all over
the empire, he being reckoned one of the most famous
conquerors in those parts, having made himself master, by
the sword, of the kingdoms of Tafilet, Fez, Morocco, and
Sus, and by this means the old tyrant (whom I was
obliged to serve) came to the throne. However, this
accident was by all reckoned a just judgment.
And now being obliged to proceed immediately for
Mequinez, I shall, after so long a digression, which is
chiefly indeed from hearsay, return to my own story, and
be upon the spur with the tribute taken upon our late
expedition, together with that for one year, for the city of
Morocco; and which being somewhat extraordinary, I

think it may not be amiss to mention the particulars of it,
whereby the reader may in some measure guess at the
richness of the inhabitants.
It consisted first of 140 quintals, or Barbary hundreds
of silver coin ; secondly, 204 fine horses, the latter four
being (over and above their wonted and required number)
a voluntary present to the Emperor, were the finest that
could be got, with saddles, bridles, &c., altogether as finely
set off, and especially that for his own riding, the saddle
being behind and before well strengthened with plates of
gold, and curiously inlaid with many very valuable jewels,
the stirrips of beaten gold, and the bridle and other
accoutrements in every point suitable, with a fine scimitar
and crooked knife, the hilts, scabbard, and sheath also very
rich, hanged to the saddle by gold chains ; thirdly, 200
mules with pads on their backs, completely fitted with
stirrups, and their bodies covered all over with scarlet
cloth ; fourthly, 200 blacks, males and females, a like
number ; fifthly, 800 quintals of gunpowder; sixthly, 4,000
gun stocks ; seventhly, 800 turrahs of fine dressed goat
skins, each turrah consisting of six skins ; eighthly, 400
quintals of butter; ninthly, 400 ditto of honey; tenth,
400 ditto of oil; eleventh, 2,000 gun locks; twelfth,
2,000 sword blades; thirteenth, 2,000 powder horns ;
fourteenth, 60 quintals of elhennah or black grass, the
same sort of that my duchess's hands and feet were dis-
coloured with at the time of our precipitate marriage ; and
fifteenth, 400 quintals of dates. All which being packed
up, the muleteers proceeded with the caravan, and we
with the army as a convoy, and got the first day to the

Tedlah, seventh to Ceedelle Feellelle, * eighth to Tendrah,
a very fertile and large plain, surrounded by vast moun-
tainous woods,—and here many of the Emperor's cows
(though no doubt it is a very dangerous place for cattle,
on account of the very great number of savage beasts
lurking hereabouts) are generally kept ; the ninth to the
river Gregrah, the country also very woody, and plentifully
stored with lions, and I think the boldest I ever saw,
coming that night even into our camp, making a hideous
and terrible noise, killing two of our horses and eating
them all up before daybreak; the tenth to the castle of
Agoory + short of Mequinez about six leagues, travelling
at the rate of about seven leagues a day; and the eleventh
we came into Mequinez in good season, and secured all
the effects of the caravan within the walls of the Emperor's
palace; and after the Bashaw had acquainted the Em-
peror with our proceedings, and given him a particular
account of the behaviour of the several prisoners, we were
all (after making a plentiful supper) ordered for that night
to rest.
The next morning, about eight o'clock, the Emperor
ordered the Bashaw to bring the several prisoners into the
yard before him, when myself and Belearge, by command
of the Bashaw, immediately guarded them in. The old
tyrant looking at them very furiously (after asking them
a few questions), told them in an angry tone "that they
were insolent traitors, and they should soon reap the
fruits of their late rebellion." Then he ordered three of the
most notorious of them to stand with their backs pretty
nigh the wall. The victims obeying, the executioner
was ordered, on the Emperor's signal, to cut off their
heads, which (the signal being given) he instantly did at
two strokes, two of them being cleanly severed at one.

Then the Emperor ordered the rest of them to be removed
to some further distance; and though, no doubt, they were
every moment expecting to share in the same fate with
their neighbours, yet did the Emperor, on their promising
him to behave better for the future (contrary to their own
and every other body's expectation then present), pardon
them, though with this restriction, “ Never more to return
to their old respective places of abode, but to reside at
those which should be by him allotted for them." Then
Belearge and myself receiving twenty-five ducats each,
and our men sis, were ordered to depart and carry off
with us the prisoners; who after being stigmatized or
branded with a hot iron in their foreheads, were like
vagrants put the next day out of the city, every one to
inquire after the place of his allotment. What became
of them after I never heard.
The execution of these three captives was performed by
the hands of an Exeter man, whose surname I have forgot,
though I very well remember his Christian one was
Absalom, * and that he often told me he was by trade a
butcher; and he was, no doubt, a very bold man, for
before the execution the Bashaw offering him his sword,
he smiling told him, that he thought his own to be alto-
gether as good, which he should soon see ; and which,
indeed, was as soon made appear; he further adding,
that had it not been of very excellent temper it could not
have performed what he had hitherto done with it.
Now are Belearge and myself again ordered into the
palace, and by the Emperor commanded to lay open several
of the presents to his view. After taking particular
notice of them, and ordering also for the fine horses, &c.,
to be brought forward, he said, “ These dogs are certainly
very rich; but what was this in comparison of what they

had yet behind, and that this was no more than their
giving him a small part of what was before his own ;
therefore, if they did not mend their manners by sending
him more for the future, he would send his messengers to
fetch it, with their heads into the bargain." Here we
may see the dangerous consequence of arbitrary power,
and thank God that we are governed by such wholesome
laws as are those of this happy nation. Here every one
is allowed fair trial in matters of life and death, as well
as like equity in the recovery and keeping their own;
whereas, those unhappy people who are subject to arbitrary
tyrants, are to-day rich and great, to-morrow beggars,
often losing their lives with their estates, all without being
heard, or any daring to inquire for why or wherefore.
If a poor man in Barbary gets but a pair of oxen to
plough, he would not only be liable to be robbed of them
by the next little mercenary governor, but forced to sell
his corn to pay an arbitrary tribute. For which reason
the land has no proprietor above two or three leagues
round a town; and if you chance to spy two or three small
cottages, you may be sure they belong to some Alcayde,
and the poor people that live in them to till the ground
are his servants, and, like the cattle, receive no other
recompense for their labour but the wretched provender
they eat.
The Emperor and his Alcaydes confound all trade in
the country, by robbing such as have any reputation for
riches. For which reason the Moors take it for a token
that you design them harm if you say they are rich; and
it is believed that there are abundance of Arabians who
have concealed estates (for this country, fifty or sixty years
ago, was extraordinary rich), and yet appear so miserable,
that they have nothing but an Alhague* to cover them,

which serves for shirt, drawers, coat, cloak, bed, and
everything. But those who lived in towns were presently
ruined. I have heard that the people of Tetuan were very
considerable traders, and some of them left off business
when the Emperor came to the throne, thinking by that
means to go off with what they had got and be quiet. But
on the contrary, being once taxed for people of substance,
the same continued till the fortunes they had got were
exhausted, and nothing coming in, they are at present
reduced to extreme want, and several of them have been
shown without a bit of bread; for all those who are in any
condition are such as continued to trade, because they
had at that time no other means of subsistence.
In 1699, the Governor of Fez sent to a merchant to give
him a hundred ducats for the tribute. He having before
got off for a great deal less went to excuse himself ; upon
which he sent for four or five negroes, and ordered them
to torment that man till he gave them a thousand. This
he paid, after being stripped and left all day in the sun,
hung up by the thumbs, and some other artful cruelties ;
and the condition of all the country is such, that any
pretence whatsoever will serve the Alcaydes to rob and
plunder their people.*-Thrice and four times happy the
inhabitants of the British Isles. Here every man enjoys
what is his own with the most undisturbed security, and
without any fear of having it ravished from him by the
hand of power. Here no haughty king dares to lay his
hand, without the leave of the laws, on the meanest of
his subjects ; much less doom them to unjust and cruel
deaths. Thankful, daily thankful ought we to be to
Heaven for placing us where the inestimable blessing of
liberty still exists ; and how jealous ought we to be of it,
and how careful that we never in the least contribute

to overthrow the noble fabric of British liberty, by any
imprudent or mercenary actions of our own.
And now for our departure for our respective garrisons
again; for which, after refreshing ourselves and recruiting
our men, Belearge and myself departed, leaving Mequinez
with our full numbers, and arrived at Tamnsnah-by the
same road, and halting at the same places as we did at
our first going thither-after the absence of seven months,
without anything particular happening on the road worthy
my notice. On our approach to the walls of the castle, all
the women, and several of the men, came forth to meet us,
which you may imagine to be a meeting both of a great
deal of joy and lamentation amongst the fair sex—those
who met their husbands rejoicing, and those who did not
behaving like other widows on suchlike occasions. How-
ever, I remember that I entered very merrily with my girl,
insomuch that I had forgot, as knowing her to be with
child before our departure, to ask her if it was a boy or a
girl, though, indeed, being settled within, this was my
first question; to which she, smiling, answered me that she
had had, about six weeks before, a daughter, but that a
certain woman had taken it from her. At which—as not
80 soon seeing through the cunning of the wench–I was
very much enraged, when the cunning gipsy ordered the
child to be brought forth, declaring the thief to be the
midwife; at which I was again pacified, and not a little
pleased with the joke, laughing and embracing the child
very heartily.
Now are some merry, and some seemingly sad, for a day
or two; after which we lived again very comfortably
together, Belearge and his people, with sixty of mine,
being departed for their respective garrisons, where, no
doubt, they were received with the like joy, mixed with
lamentations.

Now are we again at liberty to divert ourselves, spending
the best part of our time in shooting and hunting in the
woods, as indeed we spent a great deal of it that way
before our setting forth on our late expedition, but I being
in such a hurry to join the Bashaw at Morocco, I did not
then stay to mention anything of it; though here I shall
not forget to tell you that we used to spend then, as well
as now, usually four days in the week at that employ-
ment, here being vast plenty of game, as partridges,
hares, and jackals. And though our sport was attended
with great danger on account of the vast numbers of wild
beasts, even to the extreme hazard of our lives. On which
account some may think the game we got too dearly
bought. Yet did not we so, as still thinking the profit
to sufficiently compensate the danger, generally, I say,
passing therein four days in every week, and with very
good success, killing vast numbers of all kinds, coming
home at nights laden, and seldom or never failing to
refresh ourselves by a good supper of such as we liked
best, and to wash them down with a cup of good wine, for
which we never wanted, the inhabitants of the country
round bringing us in several skins a week, together with
many other presents, on account of our destroying the
wild beasts, for which purpose we set every Saturday apart,
the inhabitants joining us with their dogs, arms, &c., and
amongst us all we made a notable slaughter. At our
return home at night we never failed of three or four wild
porkers roasted whole, nor of a fresh supply of wine,
which, though two very presumptuous breaches of their
law at Mequinez, yet did we—as being of other nations,
and the Emperor winking at it-continue in it, stopping
the mouth of the priest with a flowing bowl, though I
could never bring him to eat pork.
Being now surrounded, as it were, with wild beasts, and

time upon my hands, I shall, by a short digression, acquaint
you by what means any going the road about their lawful
occasions may best escape them. And first for the tiger,
which I take to be by far the most dangerous creature,
though not so terrible as the lion, he generally lying near
the roadside on his belly, with his legs under him in a
proper posture for leaping, so that he is on his prey before
it can well avoid him, and which cannot be done at all, but
by a due observance of what I am about to tell you; and,
in the first place, I hope you will allow it highly pecessary
for travellers in such countries to carry their eyes before
their feet, whereby they may, before too nigh approach,
the better discover the enemy, and which, if they do not,
they may repent it when too late; and having so discovered
him, to take their eyes instantly off him and continue to
walk on their road, and if he is not hungry they are quite
safe. Whereas, on the contrary, should they happen to
make the least stand, and stare him in the face, he leaps
directly at them, and it is a hundred to one if they escape
with life. The lion, on the other hand, shows himself
boldly sitting on his breech with a very sour look in the
road, about twenty or thirty paces before travellers. In
this case, instead of walking on and keeping their eyes off
him, they must stand still and stare him full in the face,
hollowing at him and abusing him all they can; and for
fear he may not understand English, in the language—if
they can-of the country. Upon this hollowing and staring
at him, he gets him on his legs, and, severely lashing his
loins with his tail, walks from them, roaring after a terrible
manner, and sits himself down again in the road, about
the distance of a mile or two, when both traveller and lion
behave again in the same manner; and after proving them
thus a third time, the lion generally leaves them without
interruption. This I know to be true, having been obliged

repeated accounts to the Emperor of the revolt of a con-
siderable number of his subjects in and about Guzlan, a
strong town near the deserts, distant from Mequinez about
twenty-three days' march, after the rate of twelve leagues
a day, they having made very bold incursions into several
parts of that neighbourhood, plundering all who refused to
come into like measures with them, destroying the caravan
of the Laurbs,* a wild sort of people, coming thither from
the coast of the deserts for dates, killing sixteen of the
Emperor's blacks sent there with his credentials to receive

and bring to Mequinez their accustomed tribute; and, in
short, having thrown off all obedience, stood upon their
guard, fortifying the town with strong walls, and putting
into it great quantities of warlike stores and provisions.
On which so frequent alarms, the Emperor, being not a
little enraged, immediately ordered an army to be in readi.
ness to march against them, and myself and Belearge,
with four hundred of our men, to hasten directly to
Mequinez to join them. There we found the rest of the
army, making with us eighteen thousand horse and eight
thousand foot ready to march, sending before us four pieces
of heavy cannon and two mortars, to be forwarded over the
mountains at the expense of the several inhabitants, and
guarded with all the foot. Early on the fifth day after
we followed them with all the horse, lodging the first night
at Agoory, the castle at the foot of the mountain, where
we before finished our rout at in our march from Morocco ;
the second at the River Gregrab * ; the third at Tendrah;
the fourth at Ceedeellee Feelellee; the fifth to Tedlah,

perfection ; seventeenth at Zooyet Burnoose ; * eighteenth

Emperor's sons, who was there waiting for our coming, he
being ordered by his father to join us with sixteen thousand
foot; and after refreshing ourselves there two days, he
accordingly marched with them at our head, our whole
army being now forty-two thousand; the twentieth we
lodged at Taugahmadurt, in the province of Swagtah ; the

contents bidding us welcome twice that night, we soon
found we had work enough to do. For we had but just
time to view the situation of their garrison, and by our
engineers' orders began to work on our trenches, before
the rebels sallied forth in number about twelve thousand,
and began directly to fire upon us with small arms very
briskly; which we as briskly answering, drove them back,
and fell to work upon our trenches again. Then, about ten
at night, they having trenches without very near ours
which we were ignorant of, they gave us on a sudden such
a smart volley as in a very little time killed six hundred
of our men, and amongst them were eighty-seven of mine

and Belearge's. However, we gave them as smart a re-
ception, killing many of them, and driving the rest quite
home in at their gates, and Belearge and myself, with the
remains of our people, followed them as far as we could,
sheltering ourselves as close as possible at the foot of their
outer wall, and keeping ourselves there in great silence till
daybreak; when our General, seeing us there, and that
none of the rest of the troops had followed us, he seemed
to be highly enraged with them, calling them cowards, and
earnestly entreated our engineers to think of some safe
and speedy way for our retreat, for that, should we attempt
an open one, we must in all likelihood be taken off all to a
man by the shot of the rebels from their walls. Therefore
they, for the better and safer facilitating our retreat,
ordered to be directly cut down a great number of palm
and date trees, with which was thrown up a barricade
before a body of men, who carried on a' trench of about
six feet deep towards us, through the sand, still covering
behind them with trees, and sand on the top; so that they
got close to us, and we all safely retired through this
trench by eleven o'clock that forenoon.
This town of Guzlan lay in a flat and sandy country,
environed with three several walls and two ditches, one
within another, and without by millions of date trees,
spreading many leagues ; so that we are now obliged to
cut down many thousand of them with the fruit thereon,
and to carry matters on more discreetly and with less risk,
we having an undoubted account by several prisoners of
the enemy's strength and resolute defence, being at the
least eighteen thousand strong, and well provided with
provision, small arms, and ammunition. Therefore the
engineers said it was in vain for our men to expose them-
selves to the shot of the rebels, which they could fire upon
is all at once from their three several walls, and therefore

it would be mere madness in us to act any otherwise than
upon the defensive, till we had raised a battery, in order
for the better bringing our cannon to play upon them.
But the sand sliding so fast from underneath us, it was a
good while before it could be perfected to their minds, we
being first obliged, to prevent the sand from running, to
secure it by driving strong piles, and close buttresses
thrown between the piles and it. By this means it was
completed, our cannon mounted, and all that night we
kept a continual firing from them, throwing many balls
on their walls, though all without making the least breach,
they being built of sand, strengthened with great limbs of
trees in such a manner that we had only our labour for
our pains; and the rebels, who knew they could not receive
any damage from our firing, flouted at us after a very
joking manner. Our engineers, perceiving their mirth and
jokes, told the General that they would, in case his Ex-
cellency was so pleased, make them laugh the wrong side
of their mouths; which he consenting to, they threw in a
couple of bombs, which we soon found to take off the edge
of their laughter, and to terrify them very much, they
being followed by a great many more. And which, no
doubt, did them a great deal of damage, they being thereat
so highly provoked, that they made several sallies, though
still driven back again with great loss of men on both
sides; and though I was generally in the thickest of them,
yet I escaped, thank God, hitherto unwounded, though
indeed I could not, by the next day at noon, say I was
invulnerable ; at which time a Moor being brought by
some of our men, who had been out a-foraging, in our
camp with a mule laden with bread. The rebels seeing
this from their walls, and knowing him to be one of
their party, were so highly exasperated at, that they made
a sudden sally; and notwithstanding they were as warmly

received by us, yet did they kill of us fifteen hundred men,
and wounded me by a musket shot lodging in my right
thigh ; and which, though it was soon taken out by a
German surgeon,* a man of great skill and diligence, and
I was most carefully attended by him. Yet was it full forty
days before I was again fit for action, and then I was again
exposed to those hasty messengers, scarce a day passing
without some of them coming even so near me as my skin,
and carrying my clothes off in many places, and still the
danger increasing, as was every day sufficiently manifest,
and still the far more bloody part to come.
And now our General, on his seeing the malcontents so
resolute, ordered our engineers to consider on ways and
means for carrying on a mine under their several walls and
ditches, which they instantly undertook to do from the
trench already brought home for our deliverance, and as
quickly set about it. However, it was a long time before it
could be performed, the country being so very loose, that
we were obliged to bind it every inch as we went on by firm
timber and planks on the top, to support it, by which means
it was at last perfected, and carried successfully on under
their several walls and ditches, and at last blown up with
that success as to make so wide a breach as we all, in a
very little time, entered sword in hand. And now there
was, between us and the rebels, for the space of two hours,
bloody work, when the remnant of them retired to one end
of the town, which they had so well fortified against our
fury, that we were in a manner glad to give out for eight
days, though during this time we often saluted them with
our cannon and bombs, and they us by frequent sallies ;
and which, I think, was by far more bold and noble. But
they being reduced to a very great degree, and seeing their
lớnger resistance would be in vain, their provisions being

quite spent, and ammunition very short, they having un-
advisedly left the greatest part of it without, and which was
now in our hands : so that they began, for want of it, to
grow very faint, and many of them dying of hunger, the
remnant beat a parley, humbly imploring the General that
they might be spared with their lives, and promising, on
such terms, to surrender and behave to the Emperor for
the future with the most dutiful obedience. To which they
were very reasonably answered, that rebels reduced to such
a condition, after so long and bloody a resistance against an
army of their sovereign prince, and from whom they had
thrown off all allegiance, and in a most insolent and con-
temptuous manner bidden him defiance, were not in any
wise to be allowed to become their own choosers. Therefore
they should submit to the will of the General, who would,
no doubt, soon order such punishments to be inflicted upon
them as he was before ordered by his father to do, accord-
ing to the merits of the case.
And which, poor wretches, they, being almost all starved
and miserably wounded, were obliged to submit to, and had
all their heads instantly cut off on the spot; by which, I
think, rather than to continue longer in such misery (as
being thereby at once freed from all their calamity), they
were by far the better off. Thus ended this long and
bloody rebellion, which took us up about seventeen months,
and with the loss, on our side, of fifteen thousand of our
men.
And now our General, as not having thought, in the heat
of blood, to preserve some few of them alive for triumph,
orders vast numbers of heads, already cut off, to be carried
in lieu thereof to his father, as a present; though at last
they became stinking to that degree that he was obliged to
be contented with their ears, which were all cut off from
their heads, and put up with salt into barrels. For we had

carried so many stinking heads so long a way, it must
certainly have very much annoyed the whole army, and
probably have bred an infection in it.
Now are we obliged, on account of our wounded men, to
remain here six weeks longer; when we struck our tents,
and, after burning the town and demolishing the walls,
departed with some of them on handbarrows for Mequinez,
resting at Tarnatter six days. After which we proceeded,
leaving Muley Sherriff there with his people, marching back
so fast as we could, all the way diverting ourselves by shoot-
ing and killing many lions, tigers, and other very dangerous
wild beasts, the inhabitants all the way striving to outdo
one another in all good offices, bringing us in every day
sufficient of all kinds of provisions, both for ourselves and
horses. So that we fared very well, enjoying ourselves
with the produce of this plentiful country, having every
day fresh supplies of bread, butter, and honey, with abun.
dance of very good beef and mutton, corn, &c., and all
without. plunder or rapine.
The Emperor received us, at our arrival, very courteously,
and gave every soldier twenty ducats, he being highly
pleased with the conduct of Muley Sherriff, who he said
had sent him his reasons in writing, for not sending him
so many heads so long a way, and therefore he was highly
contented with the ears; though not, as he said, but that
the sight of the heads would have given him a great deal
of pleasure ; yet, as they were stinking, and might possibly
prove of ill consequence to the army, he thought them to
be by far better left behind. He then ordered the barrels
to be opened, and the ears to be turned out before him ;
and after looking at them for some time, he with a pleased
though stern aspect ordered them to be again put up and
laid by till another rebellion, when he would, he said, send
them to the rebels as a present. However, they were all

at last strung on cords, and hanged along the walls of the
city.
Now are Belearge and myself ordered, after recruiting
our men (as having in this so long and dangerous expedi-
tion lost at least one half), to be again in readiness, as the
next day, to depart for our respective garrisons, though
this my old and very good friend was not destined to do,
he being, poor man, that night poisoned by a woman, as
was generally supposed, in order to her getting his post for
her husband. But in this she was very much mistaken,
all his men being put under my command, and all of them
the next day marched with me, getting safe to my castle of
Tamnsnah, after the absence of twenty-one months.
Now, after visiting and settling my new men in Belearge's
old garrison of Stant, I again returned to my wife, and
stayed with her and her daughter in peace for four months.
For as I was now so far inured in their bloody civil wars, I
was seldom exempted from making one, and receiving many
wounds therein. Nor had I (during the remainder of the
reign of old Muley Ishmael, and the short reigns of Muley
Hammet Deby, and Muley Abdemeleck, two of their suc-
ceeding emperors, and until Muley Abdallah, who succeeded
the last of them, was a second time by the Black Army
driven out) any rest therefrom, unless by these little inter-
vals at Tamnsnah, and some few others at our garrisons,
which I shall take notice of in their proper place. But
being, as I said, now again with my wife at Tamnsnah, I
endeavoured to make the time as agreeable to my inclina-
tions as I could possibly, never failing to employ myself,
according to our usual days, in our old sport of shooting
and hunting, and still bringing in plenty of game, and
many skins of good wine ; though this, indeed, as I had
now many new people to deal with, was under closer cover.
Not but they might have been all soon brought to drink

wine, but being seldom or never faithful to their promise,
I was thoroughly resolved not to trust any of them in that
way; and indeed I thought wine too good for the best of
them, and therefore I was fully determined not to run any
hazard on that account.*
Now are my four months expired, and I am again ordered
directly, with two hundred of my men, to Mequinez, where
we were soon joined with two hundred more, we being all
light horse ; and we were immediately ordered by the
Emperor to proceed for Tafilet, and thence, as a convoy to
the caravan, to the castle of Toal, seventy days' journey
in the deserts, to convoy and bring safe to Mequinez his
wonted tribute from those parts. We proceeded according
to the following route :- The first day to Bittitt; second to
Suffrooe : third to the river Gregoe ; fourth to the moun-
tain Ceedehamsout ; fifth to the river Melwea; sixth to
Cassavey, a castle commanded by Muley Hasham, a near
kingman to the Emperor; seventh to Embetsgurvan ;
eighth to Buiny Menteer ; 1 ninth to Cassersook, in the
Province of Endoughrah ; tenth to Fumulhungue, and the
eleventh to the city of Taffilet, where we rested four days;
here being the beginning of the deserts this way.
The kingdom of Taffilet is famous for dromedaries, which
will travel as much in twenty-four hours as ordinary horses
do in eight days. It is much more barren than any other
part of Barbary, and has only this one city in it, in which
reside many of the Emperor's sons; for when they are of
such an age that he is apprehensive they may be a cause
of trouble at home, he no longer lets them live in the
palace. But they are disposed of as the interest of their
mothers prevail, either in some post about the Court, or
sent to Taffilet, where the Emperor gives them a plantation
of dates, on which they live. But those who have the mis-

fortune to lose their mothers, or are out of favour, come to
want, and are as much neglected as if they had not been
born, never returning to Court again.*
In Taffilet vast quantities of most sorts of commodities,
coming out of the deserts and country round, are laid up
in storehouses, till they are by the Emperor's orders other-
ways disposed of.
We now entered with our pilot and the caravan into the
deserts; who, after seventy days' travel over this sandy
ocean, he still directing us by the compass, brought us in
safety to the castle of Toal, a garrison kept by Moors,
always residing there, and where the Laurbs or Arabs,
people inhabiting those parts of the deserts, bring in once
a year their wonted tributes, as gold, ivory, indigo, &c.,
which they traffick for on the coast of Guinea.t
These Laurbs are an awkward sort of people of an
olive colour, and wearing the hair of their heads and
beards without ever cutting or topping, it runs naturally
up into rings or curls, so that their heads look all one at a
distance as if they had growing on them large bushes of
furze. Their only clothing, is a blue linen shirt, and a pair
of drawers reaching a little below their knees, with which
they are furnished by the Moors. Their habitations, or
tents, are made of the skins of tame and wild beasts.
Their food chiefly the flesh and milk of camels, as being
of all others most in esteem with them, though sometimes
they eat mutton, having many sheep of a large size, bear-
ing a long spiry hair instead of wool; antelopes, and, in
short, any other sort of flesh they can catch, as lions,
tigers, ostriches, &c., and dates instead of bread. Their
language, called Laurbea, I is much the same with that of
the Moors, as only differing some small matter in the pro-

nunciation, so that they understand each other perfectly
well.
The cattle here (that is to say, camels and sheep) are
tolerably well fleshed ; which I think to be pretty strange,
there being but here and there scarce anything of pasture
to be seen, and that chiefly in and about those places where
the springs of water rise, and where you may see vast
herds of those creatures almost continually browzing on a
long spiry weed, bearing a seed much in colour and taste
like that we call worm-feed.
When the natives kill a camel, they make him first kneel
down on his knees with his nose close to the sand, and then
they cut his throat in that posture, always beginning to
take off his skin from the bunch on his back (which is all
fat) and so downwards. Then they cut him into small long
pieces, drying all but what they reserve for present use by
the wind and sun, and then it is hung up in their tents ;
and though it is not at all salted, yet will it, if kept dry,
remain good for a long time. In short, their stomachs
being pretty much upon the cannibal, they are not very
squeamish, generally (to save themselves the trouble of
dressing) eating it raw.
We had with us in this expedition several blacks, and
amongst them one (a very stout, active, cunning fellow)
named Bushmough, a native of the Brazils, to whom one
of the chief men amongst those Laurbs had a very great
fancy, and was several times very desirous of buying him ;
and which the negro perceiving, and seeing the Laurb one
day coming again with some of his people to our castle, he
asked me why I did not sell him. “Sell you,” replied I,
“why so ? No, no, Bushmough, by no means." "Fob,”
said he, “sell me for good gold and mutton, and you shall
see I will be soon with you again.” “Oh but," said I,
“when once they have got you into their clutches, they will

not again so soon let you go as you may perhaps imagine ;
therefore, good Bushmough, be content to remain as you
are rather than to run any such hazard.” “Oh no, no,"
said he, "you need not, as to that, be under the least
concern; for you may depend on Bushmough's soon find-
ing his way back again." Upon which, and on my seeing
that I could not be at quiet from the Laurb's so pressing
and frequent importunities, and I having before received
orders from the Emperor to sell any of the blacks, by way
of furnishing the army with provisions, I sold him for
twenty gold ducats (which is just nine pounds English)
and sixty sheep; and after I had taken the Emperor's
clothes off him, and had in lieu thereof given him an old
blanket, and the money and sheep were delivered to me,
he was, by his new master, mounted on one of his own
horses, which I had the day before (by the Emperor's per-
mission also) sold him, together with several others past
our service.
And now is honest Bushmough about to depart with his
new master, calling to me in Portuguese that I should not
be under any the least doubt of his honour. For that if he
could not, according to his inclinations, get off so soon as
he intended, and I might expect, yet I might depend on his
coming back so soon as he possibly could. And then the
Laurb turned about his own horse to be going, looking
very chary at Bushmough, ordering him to ride on before
him, and was, no doubt, not a little pleased with his
bargain, bidding us all farewell; and Bushmough played
a thousand antic tricks, as long as he thought himself in
our sight.
And now is honest Bushmough gone with his new master,
with whom we must leave him seven days on hard drudgery,
he coming back to us again on the eighth, about day-break,
mounted on one of his master's best horses, and a long lance

on his shoulder, dressed only in a blue shirt and drawers,
according to the Laurbish mode, calling to me to be let
in; of which I being acquainted, hasted as quick as I could
to receive him, accosting one another very friendly, and
laughing very heartily; and after we had laughed our fill,
I asked him what he thought of the gold ducats, and if he
was not afraid I would keep them for myself. “No, no,"
said he, “ that is the least of my fear, I being, if you
please, determined with myself, that they shall be laid out
for the good of so many of us as you shall think fit;"
adding that unless it was my own fault, I should sell
him again and again. In which, indeed, he was soon
after as good as his word, for I sold him again to two other
several masters, as will be related presently. I inquired of
him the particulars of this comical adventure ; first asking
him what reception he had met with there. “What
reception ?" said he, "oh, very good, very good; I was used
very courteously indeed, and wanted for nothing they had.”
After he had related to me some of his pretty pranks
among his late owner's household, “ Very well,” said I,
“ but are you not afraid your old master will be soon bere
again to inquire after you, as you may depend he will ?
And how will you manage then ?" To which he (walking
on tip-toes laughing) told me " that he would leave that
to me, and that if I should let him go, it might not be
in his power to get his friends any more gold ducats
or mutton.” Then in an angry tone I told him that
he was a very pretty fellow, in intending to carry on
the droll further; but I could not forbear laughing, no
more than himself, I being really surprised to see the
subtlety of the creature.
However, I told him in good earnest that he should
take especial care not to let any of them see his face,
for that I was very certain that his late master would

be again with us very soon; as indeed he was the
next morning very early at our gates, inquiring if his
fugitive was come back: of which Bushmough himself
brought me the news, running hastily, and saying to me in
a soft, though pleasant manner, "My old master Laurb is
come! my old master Laurb is come !” “Your old master
come," said I; “pray what old master ?” “Why," said he,
“I tell you my old master Laurb.” “No!” said I. “Yes,
indeed,” said he," he is, for I saw him myself with the
great bush upon his horns.” “Very well,” said I, " and
don't you intend to go with him?" " Oh no, no," said he;
"but you shall see (if you will suffer me to put on a rich
dress and to mount a good horse) that I will ride out, and
soon make him glad to depart again without me; but you
must be sure to tell him that I am a very near relation to
the Emperor; which," said he,“ will be very pretty, and
then I will ride out and make some very good pastime.”
Therefore, to try his dexterity, he was soon rigged in a very
rich dress, a turban on his head, a scimitar by his side,
a lance in his right hand, and mounted on an exceeding
fine horse richly accoutered; and then I, with some others
of our people, rode out, and Bushmough in the midst of
us, appearing very grand, bold, and as unconcerned as you
please; and after my asking the Laurb what he would
have, he told me that he was come to inquire after the
black that we had sold him about eight days ago; who
was, he said, gone off in a base manner with his best
horse and lance, and that he was seen riding that way.
“Indeed!” said I, in a seeming surprise ; " but how came
you to let him go ? Certainly you must have used him
very ill.” “No," said he," he had all the encouragement
imaginable.” “Oh, the rogue,” said I; "a most un-
grateful base rogue ! he knew better than to come here.
I wish I could light on him, that I might make an example

of the base villain, to the terror of all his countrymen."
Bushmough was all this while close by the Laurb, whistling
and behaving after the most unconcerned manner, though
hearing and understanding our discourse on both sides
perfectly well; when casting my eyes round, I soon found
the Laurb had fixed his on Bushmough, muttering to him.
self that he thought him extremely like him.
At which I asked him what was the matter; when he said
aloud that the black riding the fine horse was very much
like his, and that had it not been for his rich apparel, and
grandeur of his fine horse and furniture (by which he
appeared to be a man of much higher rank), he should
actually have concluded him to be the same. When I
telling him in Portuguese what the Laurb said, he
answered me, “I know it already," still keeping his
countenance, without the least alteration of temper or
behaviour, and riding up and down by the Laurb as close
as he could, till he seemingly agreed that it was not the
same black, asking if he was to be sold. “Sold !” said
I. “Oh fie, what are you talking of ?” “Why,” said he,
“what harm is in that?” “Indeed,” said I, “ the harm is
not much between us; yet, as he is a very near relation to
one of the Emperor's wives, should he know what you said
of him, he would no doubt be very angry with you; and,
as he is a man extremely passionate in his nature, making
no more of killing a man than looking him in the face, it
might not only prove of very ill consequence to you, but it
is even a hundred to one if he did not cut off your head."
At which he seemed, and was, no doubt, in a very great
hurry to be gone, and glad if he might depart in a whole
skin, desiring me not to tell the Emperor's cousin of his so
scandalous opinion of him, bowing to him with the most
profound reverence, and Bushmough behaving like the
Emperor's cousin indeed, not so much as giving him one

nod in return, but in a scornful manner turned upon him
his back, soon after laughing very heartily to see, as he
said, how disconsolate he went off, and how much like a
fool he departed, throwing himself even in an ecstacy on
the ground, and crying out, so well as his excessive laughter
would permit him utterance, “ Laurbs ! Laurbs, Laurbs !
Oh, poor silly Laurbs !”
Bushmough's first adventure proving so lucky and divert-
ing, and being finished so well, he had now in a manner
nothing else to do than to look out sharp for another chap,
and which indeed be on the second day after had the luck
to meet with. He running hastily in and telling me that he
had just then spoke with some gentlemen Laurbs without,
who had a very great mind to buy him, and that they lived
in a quite different part of the desert from that of his old
master, I went out immediately to them and asked what
they wanted. They told me, to buy the black by my side;
and finding them to be very eager for a purchase, I seemed
altogether as indifferent and unwilling about it, by which
I screwed them at last to forty gold ducats. There was now
a dispute between the Laurbs, for some time, which of them
should have him. However, it was at last agreed by them,
that as they lived all, as it were, together, they would buy
him in partnership; which indeed they did, and honestly
paid me down the forty ducats for him.
After he bad given me sufficient satisfaction as to his in-
tentions of coming back (which he hoped would be in three
or four days at the furthest), he merrily departed with his
new masters, and was indeed better than his word, he coming
to us again the next day in good season, and when I again
asked him concerning his reception with them, he said it
was not in anywise so agreeable with his inclinations as
was that of his former masters, there not being, he said,
so proper objects of his observance; therefore he was
WA

obliged to remain their debtor, till they were otherwise
provided better to his mind. “Well, but," said I, “ you
don't, I hope, intend to go back to them, nor again to braze
it out with these as you did with the former. If you do,
I think it is high time for you to be dressing, for if I am
not very much mistaken, I see them coming,” pointing with
my finger at some people I had discovered at a distance ;
whom Bushmough also discovering, he seemed to be highly
delighted at it, and turned himself about to be going off ;
and then I asked him where he was going to. “Going to ?”
said he ; " why, going to dregs, for they will be soon here,"
intending to play again his old gambol. I told him, “No;
for that I thought he had on that subject carried on the
droll far enough before ; therefore he should, at his peril,
keep himself close within till they had an answer to their
errand and were again departed.”
However, I kept him in discourse, till the Laurbs
came so near us that we plainly made them out to
be the same; and then Bushmough cried out, “Oh
yes, yes, they be my second masters indeed,” humbly
desiring me to give him leave to make them some
pastime, “for that,” he said, “was all they were like
to have for their money, therefore it would be very un-
conscionable in me to deny it them. However, I still
persisted in my former resolution, and told him, with
seeming warmth, that in case he should offer to play any
further pranks of that nature, I was thoroughly resolved
to deliver him up to them; for that I was very certain all
his art would not be sufficient to conceal from them the
knowledge of his noble phiz, nor had these masters horns
(80 far as he could tell of) to stand in their light, as the
former master's stood in his. So he was at last constrained
to submit and tarry within, till I had heard the result of
their message, and given them an answer ; though this,

I am sure, was very much against his inclination, and he
would, no doubt, bave attempted some prank, had not I, by
several repeated commands, ordered him to the contrary ;
and then I rode out with a few of our people, and asked
them what they wanted. To which they answered me,
that they wanted the black whom I had sold them the day
before, and who, they said, ran away from them in a short
time after they had him at home. “Run away !” said I,
in a seeming surprise ; “I can scarce believe you. Pray
which way did he run ? " “Nay, that,” said they, “We
cannot tell; however, we thought he might have been come
hither.” “Hither!" said I; “ that you know he dared
not, therefore you only jest with me."
On which they confirmed it in the most solemn
manner, assuring me that he was actually run away,
wringing their hands, and lifting up their eyes together,
as though they had at once lost all they had. And
thus they continued to do for two days, still expecting
his return; when I telling them what countryman he
was, and that probably he was beating his way home,
and their provision quite spent, and having no encour-
agement of getting any more from us, they returned in a
very heavy and discontented mood without him; which
Bushmough perceiving, he called after them from the castle
wall, in Portuguese, “Here he is, here he is !” though
this indeed he knew they did not understand.
And so an end was put to his second adventure, they giving
him quite over; and he was now at liberty again to look out
for a third, in which he managed so well, that on the sixth
day following he got a new chap to purchase him, and I
sold him for the like sum, viz., forty gold ducats, but again
charged him on his life to make haste back again ; which,
if he did not (as we should be soon moving with the
caravan), we should be obliged to leave him behind us.

“No, no,” said he, “never fear that. Do you but take care
to set up at night a lighted torch on the top of the castle
wall, and never fear of my being back again before the
next daylight.” And which, indeed, he was, coming to us
soon after midniglit with two of the Laurbs' muskets, and
all their ammunition in two leather pouches, stealing with
them, he said, out of their tent whilst they were sleeping.
However, they were soon after daybreak back again to our
castle to inquire after him, sadly lamenting their loss, and
especially that of their ammunition and arms; to all which
we only gave them the hearing, they being at last no
better off than the others of their brethren had been
before them.
And now, after having had sufficient profit and pastime,
through means of honest Bushmough (though having a
very great mind to sell himself once more, he did not think
so), and all other matters finished to our satisfaction, we
packed up our treasure, and in seventy days got safe back
to Taffilet, making of it a very pleasant journey; which
I must in a very great measure attribute to the jocular
behaviour of honest Bushmough, seldom a day passing
without our meeting some of his old friends, and his sud-
denly crying out thereon, “The Laurbs! the Laurbs!"
running and skipping in the most comical manner, though
he had not the pleasure of meeting with any of his old
masters, which I dare say he of all things desired. Here
we rested seven days to refresh ourselves and cattle, and
then we proceeded, and got safe in eleven days more to
Mequinez, where we were well received by the Emperor,
sumptuously feasted by his order, and had every man
twenty ducats; and then be directly ordered us for our old
garrisons, with his service to our wives, where we safely
arrived, after the absence of six months.

of game, which was but for a very short duration, I being
all on the sudden soon after hurried away to try my fortune
in another part of the country, after a more hostile manner;
for at the end of the sixth week I was expressly ordered by
the Emperor again to hasten to Mequinez with two hun-
dred of my men, where I found ready to march, on some
secret expedition, an army consisting of sixty thousand
men, horse and foot, commanded by Bashaw Gossoy, with
whom we were joined, and the next day marched with
them, our route being, as I then understood, for Binnisness, *
on the River Wadzeetoon t or River of Olives, near the
borders of the Morocco dominions, and the country of the
Argireens, on account of their denial of paying the Em-
peror's agents their respective tributes, which they had
refused to do for a long time back, after a most insolent
manner.
The first day we marched to Fez, the second to Keessan,
third to Tessan, I fourth to a skirt of the deserts, and after
three other days march thereon to Wishaddah, a strong
garrison, to keep the Argireens in awe, and wherein the
malcontents had as strongly fortified themselves. We
lying at a convenient distance for the night, our Bashaw
sent in a messenger the next morning, requiring them to
surrender the fort to the Emperor's pleasure, and to send
him out immediately sufficient pledges of their performance.
To which he was answered, “That they were thoroughly
resolved to the contrary, and that he should find he had
not children to deal with.” With which answer the mes-
senger in a very short time returned, and then we were all
ordered to entrench ourselves. But before we could finish

our work, the malcontents sallied forth, in number about
ten thousand, who discharged their muskets on us, and
were returning again towards the castle, when six thousand
more of them within also sallying forth, and joining them,
they all of them turned upon us again, and there ensued
between us a cruel slaughter for the space of three hours,
thousands falling on both sides; and thus they continued
by frequent reliefs from the castle, to skirmish with us in
and out for three days. At they end of which, they (the
greatest part of them being already, by the force of our
superior numbers, cut off) surrendered to the discretion of
the Bashaw, Torogolgh their chief, with many others of
their principals, coming out to him with their excuses,
presents, and arrears, and amongst the former several very
fine horses, and a large sum of money for the Bashaw's
own particular use, and which, no doubt, was sufficiently
made good to them, by saving some of their lives, though
some indeed only to live a little longer.
And now am I again at leisure to look about me, as
indeed it was high time, being grievously wounded in our
last bloody skirmish by a musket shot lodging in my left
thigh, the Bashaw receiving another in his arm, much
about the same time. Mine proved extremely painful to
me, it being even to the end of the third day before my
surgeon could conveniently take it out, notwithstanding he
was a very ingenious man; and though the remains of our
army rested there two months, yet could I not ride till just
before our departure. However, I thought myself to be far
better off than a great many of our army, we having lost
therein full fourteen thousand men.
And now am I travelling back, in a great deal of pain,
with the remainder of our army for Mequinez, and with
us forty of the principal rebels in this rebellion, to give
an account of their behaviour to the Emperor. Being

brought before him, he forthwith ordered them for execu-
tion, the victims standing all in a row, and the headsman
ready with his sword drawn in his hand, only waiting the
word of command, or signal, which being given, he struck
off seventeen heads at so many strokes, when he was
ordered to stay his hand, and the other twenty-three were
pardoned, and sent back to behave with more prudence for
the future; and I, after I had recruited the men I had lost
(in all twenty-six), so fast as I could ride for Tamnsnah,
and my other three garrisons, getting thither again after
about three months' absence, finding my family in good
health, and increased by a brave boy.
Now am I, after my late skirmishes and sad wound,
again with my wife and family at Tamnsnah. There I
happened to remain with them for some considerable time
in peace and plenty, spending most of my time in my old
sport in the woods, though I went pretty often to Sallee,
and where I met with several of my countrymen, with
whom I soon got well acquainted, yet could not I (although
I very heartily endeavoured it) meet with any opportunity
to my mind, wherein I might in any probability make my
escape; and for me to make any foolish attempts that way,
I thought was by far better to let alone. Therefore, after
making merry with my countrymen sometimes for three,
four, or five days, I returned to my family and my old
sport. But as pleasure never comes sincere, a dash of
water is now thrown into our wine, our son, at the age of
ten months, dying ; though after this we lived without any
uneasiness almost to the end of two years, when a
sudden rumour ran, that the old Emperor was dead, as
indeed he had been at least two months before, though
kept private for certain reasons of state, no doubt to
strengthen the interest of some of the competitors for the
empire.

ADVENTURES OF THOMAS- PELLOW.

An excessive cruelty, a great capacity, and a perfect
knowledge of the genius and temper of his people, pre-
served to this Emperor the throne for so long a space of
time as fifty-five years, and death alone took it from him.
By strictly observing, even to the nicest particulars, all the
ceremonies of the Mahometan religion, he made himself
respected by his subjects for his virtues, at the same time
he was feared for his cruelty and vices. He always
brought his projects to bear, and if he saw there was
danger in using violence, he knew how to employ cunning.
Voluptuous, covetous, passionate, treacherous, more than a
tyrant, he tamed the natural savageness of his subjects, by
showing blmself still more savage than they.
After the death of his nephew, Muley Hamet, his cruelty
began to appear. The first scene of which was acted by
the side of a river, to which he came with his army, but
could not pass, where he ordered all the prisoners to be
killed, and woven into a bridge with rushes, for his army
to pass over upon.
In 1678, he made himself master of Taffilet, and three
years after that took Mamora from the Spaniards, where
he found eighty-eight pieces of brass cannon, fifteen of
iron, ammunition of all sorts, more than he had in his
whole dominions before, and a great prize of pearls and
jewels (belonging to merchants who then were in the
town) fell into his hands. He also took Larach from the
Spaniards in 1689, clearing all the sea-coast of his terri.
tory, but Massagan,* Pennon de Velez, and Ceuta, the
latter of which (though always blockaded with ten thousand
men, and so strictly pressed that the Bashaw cannot stir
from before it without leave from the Emperor) has defied
all attempts for thirty-four years together. In 1701, he

fought a battle with the Dey of Algiers,* but coming off
with the worst, a peace was concluded, which has con-
tinued ever since.
At the beginning of his reign the roads were so infested
with robbers that it was dangerous to stir out of the towns
without being well guarded, but he so well cleared them
that now it is nowhere safer travelling.
He maintains his large empire (which consists of several
kingdoms joined together) in peace and quietness, although
of so late an acquisition to the family. In his empire is
contained all that country called by the Romans Mauritania
Tingitana, with other provinces to the southward, as far as
Cape Blanco, where it is bounded by the Negro country, as
it is northerly by the Mediterranean Sea. It has on the
east the kingdom of Algiers, and part of the country of
Bildulgerid, and on the west the main ocean, including the
kingdoms of Fez, Morocco, Taffilet, Segelmess, Darha, Suz,
and Tremezen, over which he rules with so severe a hand,
and has struck such a dread into all men by his terrible
executions, that none of the remnants of the royal blood of
the before-mentioned kingdoms or any of his bashaws have
dared to take up arms against him. All the disturbance
be ever met with at home (since his establishment after
the conquest of his nephew) was the rebellion of his son
Muley Mahomet, who causing himself to be proclaimed
King of Morocco, plagued him for some time, but sending
his son Muley Zidan against him, Muley Mahomet was
overthrown; and the Emperor having got him into his
clutches ordered his right hand and left foot to be cut off,
after which the prince soon died, not suffering the blood to
be stopped, but tearing off the plasters.
His manner of governing is by alcaydes, who have no

commission, but receive their authority only by his saying,
“Go govern such a country; be my general or admiral."
At Court he has five standing officers. They are the Grand
Mufti, for affairs of religion; the chief eunuch, to take care
of the Seraglio; a treasurer for his revenue; the superin-
tendent of his buildings, and the Bashaw of Mequinez, who
is the first minister, or supreme alcayde, of which there
are three sorts. The first and chief are those who, in the
nature of viceroys, are sent to govern the provinces, to
whom, for their greater honour, is sometimes given the
title of Bashaws. They have an unlimited power, and it
matters not how much they tyrannize, if, upon their return
to Court, they bring riches enough to satisfy the Emperor.
Another sort are the generals of his armies, and com-
manders over small parties of horse or foot. The third
sort are governors of cities or towns, and are either made
by the Emperor himself, as are the Alcaydes of Morocco,
Fez, Sallee, and other cities, or by the governors of the
provinces over small towns and cities. A fourth sort may
be added, which are titular only, and therefore called
Alcaydes of their Heads.
The governors of the provinces are ordered to Court
every two or three years to render an account of their
government; that is, to bring the Emperor all that they
have by an arbitrary and tyrannical power plundered the
people of; by which means he gets little less than their
whole wealth, which never circulates more, but is thrown
into his treasury, and remains there an unprofitable and
useless hoard, he never parting with it again upon any
account whatsoever—for neither his armies, fleet, or build-
ings cost him anything. When he has occasion to raise
forces, the alcaydes of the provinces are obliged to find and
maintain them, each providing for a number in proportion
to the extent of his government. The ships also that are

in his service are fitted out and maintained by the alcayde
of the port to which they belong. Nevertheless he has half
the prizes, and takes all the slaves, remitting part of his
moiety of the prize goods in consideration for the slaves,
who did not belong to his share.
When the alcaydes return from their governments it is
with the greatest fear imaginable, as I have before hinted,
for if the Emperor thinks they do not bring him the whole
profits thereof, but keep something for themselves, they are
in danger of being put to some cruel death. Before they
go into his presence they pull off their shoes, put on a
particular habit they have to denote a slave, and when
they approach him fall down and kiss the ground at his
horse's feet. If he speaks to them, they bend forward and
hold their heads a little on one side in token of offering
their life, which great degree of subjection proceeds partly
from fear and partly from superstition, for they believe
him to be the true branch of the Xeriphian * family, who
draw their descent from the prophet Mahomet, and there-
fore think he was particularly favoured by Heaven, and
could do nothing amiss, but imagined all who died by his
hand went to Paradise ; in which opinions he confirmed
them by a long continuance of tyrannical power, by artifice
and by hypocrisy, never doing anything of consequence
without first falling down upon the ground with his face
close to the earth for a considerable time, making believe
that he then received inspiration and directions from God,
or Mahomet (for which purpose he had a great number of
praying places contrived in different parts, not unlike niches
laid horizontally in the ground), and that he performed the
will of God in everything he did.
The Emperor certainly punished all breakers of their law
with great severity, and carried his hypocrisy so far that it
* Shereefian is the more general spelling.

was the most religious age that ever was in Barbary by the
King's example, whose commands were esteemed sacred, for
the least breach of which he had often inflicted the severest
death; so that what from the dread of punishment and the
opinion the people are brought up in, no prince was better
obeyed.
He was an early riser, whether from his natural dis-
position, or the horror of the many murders, exactions, and
cruelties he had committed on his poor subjects and slaves,
I cannot determine ; but those who have been near him
when abroad in camps (for in his palace he was waited on
by women, young wenches, and eunuchs, who dare not tell
tales), report that his sleep was very much disturbed and
full of horror, when, starting on a sudden, he has been
heard to call upon those he had murdered, and sometimes
awake he used to ask for them whom he had killed but the
day before; and if any of the standers-by answered, “He is
dead," he presently replied, “Who killed him?" To wbich
they answered, “ They did not know, but supposed God
killed him," unless they had a mind to follow.
I have heard he used once to call often on Hameda, a
great favourite of his, when he was walking alone, and
nobody could be supposed to hear him. This Hameda was
the greatest favourite he ever had ; he was the son of the
guardian of the slaves, and came a boy into the Emperor's
army, when he was besieging his cousin Muley Hamet in
Terudant, and doing some action before him he took notice
of him and gave him a horse. The man still continued
to do good things, and being a merry buffoon fellow the
Emperor grew into great familiarity with him, insomuch
that he could take the liberty to go into his gardens when
he was with his women, which no man ever did before or
since. He had the title of Bashaw by way of pre-eminence
above all other bashaws. The Emperor used passionately

to tell him that he could never be heartily angry with him,
and that it was impossible he should be provoked to kill
him. And it was thought he did not design to do it when
he gave him so many blows with the butt-end of his lance,
that he died of them the next day. The Emperor after-
wards showed a great deal of sorrow at it, confessed he
repented of what he had done, sent him and his physicians
a bag of money, and desired him to live.
As soon as his first prayer was over, which was before
the morning star disappeared, he used to go to his works,
which were of a vast extent within the walls of his palace.
There the poor people (whether Christians, negro slaves,
boys who attended him, alcaydes, or overseers of the
works), all tasted of his anger in their turns, beating,
killing, or giving good words, according to the humour he
was in. This was one of his top pleasures ; in some of
these places and never within his palace he gave audience
to ambassadors, conversed sometimes sitting on the corner
of a wall, walked often, and sometimes worked.
In the year 1690, before he was master of Sahra,* there
came a woman from that people to him, who, hearing of
her coming, went to meet her on horseback, at the head of
twenty thousand men. She told him the people of Sahra
were desirous to put themselves under his protection, but
that he must fight her at lance-play, if he had a mind to
have her, at once the pledge of their fidelity and the prize
of his victory. She set him hard at first, but afterwards
suffered herself to be overpowered, was put among the rest
of his women, and troops were sent to protect the frontiers
of Sahra.
When he was abroad, there used to be carried after him
a stool, a kettle of water, and a skin, which was his table-
cloth. This belonged to his eating. And if he was out at

dinner time, his dinner was carried after him upon the
head of a negro, in a great wooden or copper vessel, which
he did not take from his head till the Emperor asked for
it. The manner of his eating did not differ from the
ordinary Moors. His other travelling utensils were two or
three guns, a sword or two, and two lances, because one
broke once as he was murdering. Both the swords and
lances were carried with their points upwards. These
were all carried by lusty fellows; his boys carried short
Brazil sticks, knotted cords for whipping, a change of
clothes to shift when bloody, and a hatchet, two of which
he took in a Portuguese ship, and the first time they were
brought to him, killed a negro without any provocation, to
try if they were good.
Although the natives of his dominions are whites, yet
they are not so much esteemed by him as the blacks and
the copper-coloured, to whom he commits the guard of his
person, and was so fond of their breed, that he took care
to mix them himself, by matching them to the best-com-
plexioned of his female subjects.*
Thus he took care to lay the foundation of his tawny
nurseries, to supply his palace as he wanted, into which
they were admitted very young, are taught to worship and
obey that successor of their Prophet, and being nursed in
blood from their infancy, become the executioners and
ministers of their wrath, whose terrible commands they

manner of using him, made a scene very much resembling
the picture of so many devils tormenting the damned.
They were so ready to murder and destroy—even while
young—that the Alcaydes trembled at the very sight of
them, and the Emperor seemed to take a great deal of
pleasure, and placed much of his safety in them, for they
surrounded him almost wherever he was. They are of all
ranks and degrees; some were the sons of his chief Al-
caydes, others picked up by chance, or taken from a large
negro town joining to Mequinez,* which the Emperor had
filled with families of blacks and tawnies for his use. If
they were well looked and strong, they needed no other
quality ; some who had relations that were able were fed,
clothed, and lodged by them; others who had not were
lodged in the outskirts of the palace, in great rooms,
where they pigged an bundred or two together. They
wore only a short and small coat without sleeves, which
did not reach to their knees; their heads were shaved and
always exposed to the sun, for he affected to breed them
hard. Most, and sometimes all of them, were employed
in his buildings, where they took off their clothes, and
laying them all in a heap, every one took a basket and
removed earth, stones, or wood ; when they had done, he
ordered them to go to his Jew and receive so much soup;
the next day they appeared gay and under arms.
He beat them in the cruelest manner imaginable, to try
· if they were hard ; sometimes you should see forty or fifty
of them all sprawling in their blood, none of them daring
to rise till he left the place where they were lying, and if
they were discountenanced and out of heart at this usage,
they were of a bastard breed, and must turn out of his ser-
vice. I never heard that he killed but three of them, one for
a heinous crime, and two for hiding a piece of bread in the

hole of a wall, which it was supposed they could not eat,
for they are great reverencers of bread, and take up (as all
Mahometans do) the least crumb, wherever they find it,
and kiss it. When they wanted clothes, the Emperor
thought of somebody that had too much money, either
Moor or Jew, and bade them go to him, and receive each a
coat or shirt.
They were generally about eight hundred in all, who
lived with him in a sort of subordination to one another ;
several had the names of Alcaydes, as the chief of them
who waited on the Emperor's person; others were made
overseers of some task or work the Emperor had ordered
them to finish; some he made perpetual Alcaydes over a
certain number of his companions, and such a one was to
answer for the rest, as to their diligence, cleanly and good
deportment in all particulars; and it was wonderful to see
the indolence, state, and gravity of these young rogues,
and how they apod the old Emperor in their way of
government; for though they could only inflict blows,
yet they used the haughty phrases of command, and
talked of cutting throats, strangling, dragging, and so
forth.'
The first mark of their preferment, after they were
grown too big to serve the Emperor in this nature, was
giving them a horse—a horseman being in the highest
esteem imaginable among them, and the foot the contrary,
insomuch that those who commanded thousands of them
were not esteemed equal to the commanders of fifty horse.
Then the Emperor either recommended them to some of
his Bashaws or great Alcaydes employed against the
Christians, or the Berebbers that inhabit the mountains,
or kept them near him, and then they were ready to be
entrusted with all important messages, as to carry the
Emperor's letter of thanks to any officer who served him

well, or to call him cuckold, spit in his face, give him a
box on the ear, strangle, or cut off his head.
When they had waited a considerable time, if no com-
mands or government became vacant, he sent them to
gather the tribute of some country, with the title of an
Alcayde ; and if any remained by him without any em-
ployment after performing this service, he was called
Alcayde of his head, which was a sort of an Alcayde titular
or Reforme, as I have noted above. But perhaps the
Emperor suspected that he had put something more in his
pocket than ordinary, then he bid him build houses of such
or such dimensions, and that he might seem something
more reasonable than the Egyptian taskmasters, used to bid
him take his lime and stone. The poor man begins with
a good heart, and when he has spent all, despair forces
him to go to the Emperor, and tell him he is not worth
one farthing more, lest he should find his work standing
still, and bury him alive in one of the walls. The Emperor
then used to pick a quarrel with him, cut him with his
sword, wound him with his lance, or take off his clothes,
all but his drawers, give him five hundred blows on the
buttocks, put him in prison, or load him with two great
chains, and send him to labour at the house he was
building, and ordered somebody else to finish it. Now you
must know the Emperor never beat a man soundly, but
the man was in the high way of preferment, and it was ten
to one but His Majesty passing by him in chains a few
days after, and finding him in a sad pickle, he called him
his dear friend, uncle, or brother, and inquired how he
came into that condition, as if he knew nothing of the
matter, sent for a suit of his own clothes (which was a
great compliment), made him as fine as a prince, and sent
him to govern some of his great towns; for by this means
he was sure he had not left him worth a groat, and made

a careful computation of what he might get in his govern-
ment, till it was his turn to be squeezed again.
They tell a story of a Spaniard who was esteemed a
good marksman, and bribed to shoot the Emperor: he so
missed his aim, that the two balls he had charged his gun
with, flew into the pommel of the Emperor's saddle. The
man was immediately seized, and when it was expected be
would be put to a cruel death, the Emperor first reproached
him with his base design, asking him what he had done to
deserve being used so, whether he was no more beloved,
and people were tired with him; then calmly sent him
to the works among the rest of the Christians. The
Spaniard, fearing he should not come off so, and thinking
it a means (if there was any) to get his liberty again,
turned Moor, but continued in his Christian habit. Some
years after, the Emperor, going among the workmen
where he was, asked him why he did not pull off his hat.
He answered, he was a Moor; and the Emperor, being
informed who he was, ordered him to be freed immediately,
asked him a thousand pardons for keeping him at work so
long, dressed him from head to foot, and made him a
governor of some country.
A little more or less this was the treatment of his
grandees : to-day hugged, kissed, and preferred; to-morrow
stripped, robbed, and beaten. Many of the people about
him bore the marks of his sword, lance, or short sticks :
and the face and arms of the negro who carried his
umbrella when Captain Norbury was there, was scarred all
over with cuts that the Emperor had given him, it was
supposed, for letting the sun come upon him; for he was
exceeding nice in his tyranny, and when he had done with
his lance, he darted it suddenly into the air, and it must
be caught before it comes to the ground, or he would kill
the man appointed for that purpose.

146 ADVENTURES OF THOMAS PELLOW
If he chanced to kill anybody when he had not
determined their death—as it frequently happened-he
civilly begged their pardon, and said he did not design to
kill that poor man, and laid the fault on God, saying his
time was come, the powers above would have it so.
If he designed the death of a Christian whom he cared
not to pardon, he shut the gates of his palace, that
Maestro Juan should not come; for it was very singular
that this Maestro Juan, a Christian slave of Catalonia, by
his good works, temper, and sincerity wrought so much
upon the Emperor, that he once swore he would never see
him but he would give him something, and that he should
never ask him anything but he would grant it; and that,
being desirous to keep his word, made him fear that Juan
shoặld come to beg such a man's life; nay, sometimes
having seen him first, he cried out he must give him
something, for he had seen him.
The Emperor was wonderfully addicted to building; yet
it is a question whether he was more addicted to that, or
pulling down ; for they said if all his buildings were now
standing, by a moderate computation they would reach to
Fez, twelve leagues off. And those who had been near
him since the beginning of his reign, have observed him
eternally building and pulling down, shutting up doors and
breaking out new ones in the walls. But he told them
this was done to occupy his people. “For," said he, “if
I have a bag full of rats, unless I keep that bag stirring
they would eat their way through.” He also dug many
strange caverns in the earth of all sizes, some for corn,
others for powder, arms, brimstone, and money, of which
latter it is suspected he left no witnesses, when finished.
The Emperor never parted with any money, to defray
the expenses of war or building, and caused his large and
magnificent palace to be erected, without expending a

blankill towards it. But instead of money he gave the
Alcayde of his buildings a government; which then was
all that country lying between Mequinez and Tremezen, a
large tract of ground, and a very fruitful soil; but con-
sidering the continual employment and unlimited expenses
which his office obliged him to, it was thought he could
not get anything for himself, more than what sufficed for
his maintenance.
Although this Emperor had eight thousand wives, nine
hundred sons, and about three hundred daughters, yet he
was always attentive to the affairs of the State, and never
committed the care of it out of his own hands.
Muley Hamet Deby,* one of his sons, whom he had
designed for his successor, hearing of his father's illness,
came with all despatch from Tedla (where he resided) to
Mequinez, to see him. It was not but with much difficulty
that he got the liberty of speaking to him, and he was at
last but badly received. The father, persuaded that interest
rather than affection was the motive of this visit of his
son's, told him to moderate his eagerness for the crown;
but the son protested to his father, that the pleasure of
seeing him was the only motive of his coming.
Hamet Deby found, by the condition in which he saw
his father, and from the opinions of the physicians, that
he could not live long, he therefore took all possible
methods to prevent disturbances, and to assure himself of
the crown; for he had many rivals for it, and amongst
others two of his brothers, Muley Abdallah, and Muley
Abdemelick, t who was accounted one of the most able
generals in the kingdom. These had all been secretly
making great preparations ; but Deby bad, by his prudence
and vigilance, disconcerted all their measures. He had
bought with him only a thousand men, but as soon as he

knew of the different parties which were forming in the
kingdom, he drew from the provinces of his jurisdiction
five hundred foot more, and six hundred horse, whom
causing to enter privately in the night into Mequinez, he
seized upon all the advantageous posts therein, and obliged
the governor to render to him an oath of fidelity. During
this, the disorder of the Emperor Muley Ishmael, together
with his great age, put an end to his life the 22nd of March,
1727, in the 81st year of his age.*
The moment his death was known, all the inhabitants of
Mequinez retired every one to their houses, abandoning all
the public works on which Muley Ishmael had unprofit-
ably kept them incessantly employed. The same day the
Bashaw Mesael presented the keys of the city to Muley
Hamet Deby, who, without losing any time, went to take
possession of the palace, and the apartment of his deceased
father. He ordered him to be buried in the night, in a
place he himself had fixed on, and gave orders for erecting
a monument over him, according to the fashion of that
country, viz., a large tower, on the summit of which were
placed five balls of gilt copper.
The measures which Deby had taken were not useless.
The very day that the death of his father was made public,
he was acknowledged by the inhabitants of Mequinez as
King of Morocco, notwithstanding the attempts made to
defeat it by his brother Muley Abdallah ; who being in-
formed of all that passed by his mother, waited in vain for
a favourable opportunity of having himself proclaimed
King; and with this design he drew together some troops
in the neighbourhood of Mequinez, expecting that seven
thousand men in the city, who had promised to espouse his
part, would come and join him. But the vigilance of Deby,
and the zeal of the Bashaw Mesael, hindered these from

putting their design into execution ; so that the troops
which were with Abdallah seeing this reinforcement did not
join them, abandoned that prince, leaving only sixteen
horse with him. This desertion entirely ruined his affairs;
so that to save his life he fled to a sanctuary. Deby
caused him to be sought for, and learning that he had
taken refuge at Fez, in the Mosque of Muley Idris, which
is held in great veneration by all the Mahometans, he
caused it to be told that prince, that he might with all
safety repair to Court, giving him his solemn oath that he
would neither hurt him, nor any that should accompany
him. Abdallah trusting to the King's promise, went to pay
his respects to him. Hamet received him with kindness,
and having pardoned him and embraced him, gave him, as
a tokep of his friendship, a very fine horse, most richly
caparisoned. It was by this act of generosity that Deby
signalized the day of his coronation, the ceremony of
which was performed in the Mosque of the great Seraglio.
The principal officers of the Army of the Blacks assem-
bled together, crying out, “ Long live the King !” and
threatening death and destruction to every one who would
not acknowledge him. Hamet Deby went out from the
palace, to hear what they had to say. They told him they
were deputed by the Army of the Blacks to assure him they
were ready to execute his orders, and if necessary to shed
their blood in his service. The King was so pleased with
this deputation, that he gave these officers two hundred
and twenty thousand ducats to distribute among the Black
Army, and ordered that they should march immediately
against the Alarbes of the province of Duquela, who had
not acknowledged him.
The deputies immediately returned to their camp, pitched
about six leagues from Mahmora, and distributed among
the soldiers their shares in the King's liberality; so that

the whole army were eager to march on the expedition they
were ordered upon.
The Alarbes * did not let themselves be surprised.
Hearing of the march of the Blacks, they prepared them-
selves for an engagement. The two armies soon came
within sight of each other. The Blacks resolved to attack
the Alarbes in their camp, which was entrenched by camels
and other animals, lying down. However odd such a
fortification might appear, it was not without a great deal
of trouble that the Blacks could force it. Both sides fought
with great fury; at length the Blacks, equal in courage to
the Alarbes, and superior in numbers and discipline, gained
a signal victory. Sixteen thousand of the Alarbes were
cut in pieces, with the loss only to the victors of fourteen
hundred men killed, and sixteen hundred wounded. The
loss of this battle prevented the provinces, who had taken
part with the Alarbes, from continuing in their revolt. The
Black Army overran them in fifteen days, without meeting
with any considerable resistance. At length the Alarbes,
having desired a suspension of arms, submitted to the
clemency of the King; who, though he gave them a pardon,
did, notwithstavding, give secret orders to his generals to
drain the riches of these rebellious provinces, without,
however, depopulating them. And these orders were indeed
punctually executed, being highly agreeable to their natural
avidity.
The first certain intelligence I had of the advancement
of Muley Hamet Deby to the throne, was by Alcayde
Larbeet Benabbo Woldernjottlee,t then head governor of
that province; who, with 1800 horse, came one morning
within musket-shot of my castle ; to whom I sent one of
my people, to know his pleasure, and to tell him, that in
case he had anything to say to me he should advance with

a few only to the foot of the wall, and let me know it ; but
if he, on the contrary, persumed to draw his main body
on any farther, I should be obliged to fire upon them.
And which he well knowing to be my positive orders, and
that I would actually have performed it, he came with a
very few, and told me, that the old Emperor was actually
dead, and that Muley Hamet Deby was, by the general
consent of the Black Army, proclaimed at Mequinez in his
room.
This Muley Hamet was a man of a most generous, though
very sottish nature, being almost ever drunk, giving the
Blacks a great deal of gold, and many other valuable
presents, insomuch that their hearts were for the present
entirely his. The governor advising me to go directly to
him, and submit myself to his will, telling me that he
thought it in all likelihood to be by far the better and safer
course ; and which I also thinging to be so, I (after giving
my people very strict charge concerning the garrison)
accordingly did, the governor going also with me; and we
were both of us very kindly received by him, and I directly
ordered back, and again to return with all my men.
And now am I soon about to leave my old, so much
beloved habitation, for such as my future chance might
happen to allot for me ; and after bidding adieu to all
my rural diversions, and merry.makings thereabout, and
settling my garrisons under the care of the country people,
who had been trained up to arms, much in like nature of
our trained-bands, we departed together after a very dis-
consolate manner, though we got all well to Mequinez, and
were by the new Emperor all most kindly received, and
each man immediately presented with new clothes, fire
arms and swords.
Here we stayed about four days; then we were sent to
Hartan, a castle about six miles out of the city, where the

ambassadors of foreign princes generally lodge at night,
before they make their public entrance into Mequinez ;
where we stayed six days, and then were sent to the castle of
Agoory, and from thence, after having been there two
months, to the siege of old Fez, the inhabitants there and
thereabout, on the death of the old Emperor, throwing off
all future allegiance to any of his successors, as thinking
themselves thereby entirely delivered from their so long
grevious bondage, now acknowledging no lawful king, killing
Alcayde Boel le Rosea,* their old Governor, boiling his
flesh, and many, through spite, eating thereof, and throw-
ing what they would not eat of it to the dogs, killing also
thirty-six of his head servants, whom they said had also
committed many insolencies against them. All which
coming to the Emperor's ears, he forthwith ordered an
army, consisting of one hundred and twenty thousand men,
horse and foot, to be in readiness to march from Mequinez
against them, myself and all my men being of the number;
and it being but twelve leagues, we marched the first day to
Embaddumab, and the next, in good season, to the walls
of the city, where we entrenched ourselves. Here we had
shrewd skirmishing with the malecontents in and out for
forty-eight days, and during which were slain on both sides
many thousand men ; when Muley Mustada, one of the
Emperor's brothers, arrived at our camp with a commission
from him to offer the malecontents quarter on the following
easy conditions, viz., that they should immediately sur-
render, and promise to him future obedience; on which he
was ready to pardon them for all that was past. These
terms, indeed, they accepted of, though I think I never saw
anything of that nature accepted with so much seeming
indifference, they bringing him out only such presents to be
carried back to his brother as they pleased.

And now we were all ordered to march back again to
Mequinez; and though I lost in this expedition several of
my men, yet did I, as to my own part, escape for this bout
unwounded, as indeed I did soon after in an affair of a far
more dangerous though quite different nature; and which,
I hope, will be by all allowed to be a very extraordinary
providence, and which I shall, after I have finished the
small remainder of my present expedition, give you a
particular account of. During our stay at Old Fez, came
Captain Russel to New Fez, who lodged there a night or
two, visited our army, then went to Mequinez, and in a
little time redeemed the few English captives then there.*

from any of their bloody actions for some time), before
my mind ran altogether upon escape; and after I had
with myself agreed on the means, which was to go first
for Sallee, and if I could not to my mind speed there, to
travel on to Marcegongue* to the Portuguese garrison there,
if I could bring it to pasş, several to my knowledge having
before made their escapes that way—as indeed so should I

now, had I not most unbappily precipitated myself into the
enemies' hands.
· For as I could find no ship at Sallee, I travelled
on to Marcegongue, which is about three days and a
half's journey further to the southward, and where the
fourth following night I got without any accident, and, to
my most unspeakable joy, even close home, or within a
hundred yards at the utmost, of the castle walls. And
here we may soon see the lubricity of mundane affairs;
for I was, even in the height of this my excessive joy, laid
hold on by four Moors, who had that night been upon the
plunder in the gardens, but had been disturbed therein by
the Portuguese sentinels. But the night being excessive
dark and windy, they in a narrow passage between two
garden walls ran right against me; and laid fast hold
of me. When I telling them I was a Christian (as sup-
posing them to be some of the Portuguese, a very un-
happy mistake) I was carried by them in a little time
back to their main guard, and confined in irons, and
early the next morning conducted by a strong party
of them to Assamoore, a town to the northward of
Marcegongue about five leagues ; and where, after being
severely handled by them, I was carried before Simmough
Hammet Beorsmine,* their then commanding officer,

people's rising against him, fled to the Emperor for assist-
ance), who ordered the Moors to put me in prison till his

ished. “When he returns,” said they, “who can tell how
long that may be, or if it may be ever; for if he meets
with his reward, the Emperor will there cut off his head,
and therefore this fellow shall be put to death directly."
“No," said Beorsmine, “I tell you he shall not now, neither

shall he be at all till the Governor's return, and which may
be sooner than now you imagine.” Upon which they cried
out I was a Christian, and about to make my escape to
Christian-land. To which the Governor made them no
answer, neither had they the power to tell him that they
had it from my own mouth, at their first surprising me.
However, it was at last agreed between the Governor and
them, that I should be kept till their next market-day, when
I should be put to death in the market-place; and as that
would be on the next Thursday, and it being then Sunday,
it could not make any difference, and during that time the
neighbourhood might be acquainted with it, and come in
and see the execution.
And now am I, as any may suppose, under a most
grievous agony, the next Thursday being the peremptory
day fixed for my execution ; and for their better securing
me, I was directly guarded away by a multitude of those
bloodthirsty villains, and put into a very deep and dark
dungeon, there to be kept without any allowance from them
besides bread and water, though the Governor sent me in
the evening a servant (in whom he could confide) with some
meat, and to tell me that I should not be under any appre-
hension of danger from the mob, for that he had truly
considered my case, and that he would deliver me from
their rage, even to the hazard of his own life. And this
he, by his servant, repeated twice every day, till the ap-
pointed day for my execution came. And when he early
brought me my breakfast that same morning (to which I
then had but little stomach) he told me that I should not
despair, for that his master still continued his friendly
resolutions towards me, and that he was very well assured
he would deliver me out of their hands, for that he had
often told him so in the most positive manner.
This, I must own, moderated my fear in some measure ;

but as it was but the promise of an infidel, and at second
hand, which made it the more uncertain, how could I
otherwise choose but be still under a very great agony, as
indeed I really was, and more so, when about ten o'clock
these bloodthirsty villains came, hauled me out of my
dungeon, and led me through the street to the market-
place, being attended by an insolent mob, still increasing
as we went, so that by the time we got to the market-
place, which was sufficiently crowded by the barbarians,
to feast their eyes with the blood of an innocent Christian,
I was almost ready to expire. And now, notwithstanding
I saw Simmo Hammet * amongst them as indeed, I
did from the moment of my being first hauled out of my
prison, yet could not I help, at sight of a long murdering
knife in the hand of the executioner, being stricken with
a very great terror. Nay, 80 great indeed, as is scarce
possible to be here expressed. For though Simmo Hammet
had faithfully promised me all the assistance in his
power, yet was it at such a time very much to be doubted
if that power would be sufficient to save my life, and
especially as I was exposed to the rage of an insolent
mob; who, though they be in some cases accounted good
servants, yet are they, I think, on the other hand (like
wind, fire, and water), bad masters; therefore I expected
nothing less than death. The executioner had now his
knife ready in his right hand, and with his left hand
had taken fast hold of my beard, the better to hold back my
head to cut my throat, when my guardian angel stepped
forth, and took the knife out of his hand ; and which,
had not be done that very instant, he would, no doubt,
therewith have soon taken from me the small remainder
of life that was left in me, without any addition to my
pain. For, in short, had be then cut my throat, I was

before so much 'stricken' with the thoughts of immediate
death, that I should not have felt it; and though I had
been death before in so many various shapes, yet could
not I then for my life behave with better courage.
And now is there a very hot dispute between the mob,
whether I should die or not being the question ; insomuch,
that had not Simmo Hammet procured a good party from
the neighbouring parishes, it would in all likelihood
(notwithstanding his office) have gone very hard with
me. However, it was at last agreed by all of them that
I should be again sent back to my dungeon, and there
to remain till the next market day, and which they plainly
told the Governor should actually be my last. Therefore
I should not feed myself with vain hopes and fancies, for
that it should not then be in the power of him or any.
body else to prevent it.
But, on the other hand, I was by the Governor alto-
gether as much encouraged, and plainly told not to
despair, for that he would deliver me out of their
hands, even to the hazard of his own life; and lest
they might offer me any foul play in my prison, he
solemnly promised me that he would order a good look-
out about it. Which you may imagine, as I had hitherto
found him so punctual to his honour, made my imprison-
ment much more supportable, though I was again the
next market day hauled by the mob to the market-place,
and by my guardian angel again brought back, as indeed
I was a third time. After which he came that night to
my dungeon, desiring me to be of good courage, for that
I should no more be hurried by the mob to the market-
place; that he expected Elemensore's return in a very
little time, which he said (as he understood he had been
very favourably received by Muley Hammet Deby) he
hoped it would be to his satisfaction, as well as that of

all his friends. However, it was to the full expiration
of two months before he came, and then he came with
sufficient strength indeed, and in open daylight delivered
me from my nasty prison, and set me again at liberty to
depart where I would, out of the reach of my cruel
persecutors. And as I had promised them, upon my
honour, to return again to Agoory, so I did, and got
thither again (even beyond my own expectation) after
the absence of about four months. And, what I was
much surprised at, I never once heard the least syllable
from the Emperor concerning this my attempt to escape.
Now am I, instead of entering the walls of Marcegongue,
returned safe to my family at Agoory: and which, though
quite the reverse of my intentions, yet must I ever
acknowledge it to be, even in the highest degree, very
extraordinarily providential, and what I could never have
expected. But I never told my wife the least word of this
affair. Whilst I was in the middle of these reflections,
I received an account from Mequinez, that the Black
Army had all of them revolted from Muley Hammet Deby,
in favour of Muley Abdemelick, and that they had sur-
prised Muley Hammet in his own house, keeping him
there, under a very strict guard, close prisoner, and, as
most thought, very sufficiently guarded, though he found
means to escape. And Abdemelick, though he was then
at Terridget,* and it was six weeks before he came, yet
he was immediately proclaimed Emperor of Mequinez,
with the general approbation; and after, at his coming,
no less received. The first thing he did was a bloody,
and I think most unaccountable, revenge on Muley
Hammet's servants, putting so many of them as he
could light on instantly to death, sending me with four
hundred light horse to the castle of Tessout, about two

days' journey short of Morocco, there to join some other
troops, to cover and demand the Emperor's dues. And
this, though my heart was with Muley Hammet, I was
directly obliged to do. On our first coming thither we
were received by the ivhabitants in seeming friendship,
but soon finding them beginning to play tricks with us,
as allowing us no more than half a pint of flour a day
for two men, and using us thus for seven days, and
stripping our people going out singly to fish in their
rivers. This not in the least pleasing us, and knowing
it in our own power to redress our own grievances, we soon
made such reprisals as our necessities required, and they
deserved, killing about eighteen of them, and they seven
or eight of us; and had not Bashaw Belide Shawey
suddenly alarmed us that Muley Hammet Deby was
within a day or two's journey of us with thirty horse
only, again going back to try his fortune at Mequinez,
we should soon have taught them better manners. On
which we left them and went directly to him, and marched
with him to Mequinez, where he expected sufficient forces
ready to receive him, and where, indeed, the Black Army,
who were all again revolted from Muley Abdemelick to
him, and all encamped without the walls of the city,
waited his coming, Muley Abdemelick being within with
most of the citizens, making what defence they could to
keep him out. But at the end of forty-eight hours, or
thereabout, Muley Hammet's forces, still increasing, got
in, and, after a faint resistance, put vast numbers of them
to the sword, and him again in possession of the city.
But as to Muley Abdemelick, he was obliged to seek
further after before he could find him, he being with a
few fled thence through a by-gate in the night-time, as
was rumoured, to Old Fez. And which, indeed, proved
to be true, though on confirmation of this report, and of

his being there well received, he was, by a body of Muley
Hammet's army, consisting of sixty thousand men, soon
followed, costing much blood, time, and expense before
we could get him thence.
Now am I one in the above number before Old Fez,
Abdemeleck being within strongly fortified, resolutely
resolved and well provided, bravely defending himself
six months and fourteen days, and during which scarce
a day passed without skirmishing and much slaughter on
both sides. But I am, to my very great satisfaction,
even to the middle of the siege, unwounded, and sent
very unexpectedly (though to my great content) to Sallee
with a few of my men, there to forward, with all possible
expedition, the making new carriages for our field pieces,
the old ones being, through the so frequent shocks of such
weighty and high-metalled cannon (thirty-six pounders of
brass), to that degree shaken, as they were become in a
manner unserviceable. So, after taking the dimensions,
I was hurried away with a strict charge therewith to
return as soon as possible. The second day I got thither,
and delivered my charge to Amberk Foolan,* a black, the
then Governor; and by him the shipwrights were directly
ordered to work, and to be as expeditious as possible. Yet,
supposing all hands at work, the carriages being in all
thirty-six, they could not finish so soon, but what I might
again have time sufficient to gratify my curiosity in the

all imaginary efforts that way, be the consequence what
it would. For as the country was then in very great con-
fusion, and the place I was then in very likely for my
purpose, I thought I could not desire a more favourable
opportunity.
And now are mine eyes busily employed in looking
sharp out after the ships then in the barbour, and my
thoughts (in case I could not in any probability perform
my design by myself) on what other help I might with
safety procure me; and which, indeed, I soon found to be
the most difficult and dangerous point; though to do it
alone, if I could, I was thoroughly resolved upon. Not-
withstanding I made all the inquiry I could, yet could not
I to my mind find any proper assistance, though on the
other hand such a glorious opportunity offered as could
not but be accounted, with the assistance of one or two
more, a very plausible and easy undertaking, and which
was as follows :-Early the next morning, after my arrival
at Sallee, I took a walk to the seaside where ships' boats
generally put in at, and where I met two Moorish sailors
just landed with a few empty barrels to fill with water ;
and, after a very courteous salute, I asked them what
vessel they belonged to, their lading, and whither bound.
To which they answered, To such a sloop (pointing at
her), bound to Santa Cruz, and laden with gums, bees-
wax, and copper. “Very well,” said I, “but have you
on board no good wine or brandy?” “No, indeed,"
said they with a sigh, "so far as we can tell of, and in
short if there was, very little of it would fall to their
shares.” “Alas !” said I, “poor hearts, I thought that
sailors could not live without it.” When they, shrinking
up their shoulders, telling me, “There was no help for
it," I left them, seeming for the present to take no further
notice of them, till they had filled the water and got the

casks again into the boat, and then I came to them again,
telling them “that I thought the few casks they had
with them held but a small matter of water for their
ship’s company, as being, no doubt (as the sloop was
upwards of fifty tons), five or six." "Oh,” said they,
"we are in all eight, though no more kept on the vessel
than us two, the other six being constantly on shore
waiting a fair wind. Our main sea store of water is
already laid in, and this (without our using of that) only
for us two for present spending; and if it is not enough,
you know it is not very far to fetch more.” “Really," said
I, “that (as none can tell how long your voyage may be)
is very well considered, and, as all must agree, to leave
than lack is by far the better policy," turning from them
in a seeming manner to be going off; but I turned me
quick round again, and told them, “If the wind stood
out of the way till the next day, it should go very hard
if I did not find for them a dram or a glass of wine,"
seeming again to be going off; when they, to my very
great satisfaction, and as, indeed, I really expected, asked
me if I would go off with them and see their vessel.
“Why, really," said I, “ that is what I would do with all
my heart, but that then I could but badly spare so much
time. However, as I had not been on board any vessel
for a long time, and in case I was certain of my being
again in a little time brought back, I could even find in
my heart to go with them.” “Well," said they, “ as to
that it shall be even as you please." So I stepped into the
boat, went with them, was kindly received, and treated
with such as they had. And after I had employed my
tongue so far as I thought fit in telling them my present
state, as how I was one of the Emperor's soldiers, that
inder him I bore an office of some distinction, and
mine eyes in viewing the dimensions of the sloop, sails,

&c., so nigh as I could guess, and given them my hearty
thanks for my so kind welcome, I humbly entreated them
to put me again on shore; and which they, after telling
me they should be very glad to see me there again,
instantly did, kindly for that time bidding one another
farewell.
Now is my heart to that degree inflamed, that every
drop of the blood in my veins is upon the ferment how
I should manage in this affair. To do it alone I found
was impossible, and to communicate it to others exceed-
ing dangerous ; though which I must be obliged to do,
or let all drop; not but I could of myself easily manage
and overcome the two Moors, but to sail and navigate
the vessel was the main point. And now am I at a
greater debate with myself than ever who those associates
should be, though I very luckily thought on one in a very
little time, named William Hussey, a Devonshire man,
and whom I soon determined in myself to be a very
trusty and honest man. And as he was then one of my
soldiers, and in Sallee with me, I could let him gradually
into the secret when I pleased ; and which, indeed, you
may suppose I did the first opportunity, for in less than
an hour after I singled him out, and began to discourse
him after the following manner :-"Now, Will," said I, “I
desire you will answer me sincerely to a question I am
about to ask you." " That,” said be," you may depend
I will, be it what it will.” “Then,” said I,“ do not you
think yourself to be better off here than to be in the
camp before Fez, where are, no doubt, some even this
moment expiring of their wounds, others receiving fresh
ones ? Would you not still think it safer and better to
be in your own country? And would you not rather run
some small hazard to make your escape, than to go back
again to such bloody dogs to run a greater ? " "Yes,"

said he, "to be sure ; and could I find any probable
means for it, they should never see my face in their
country more; that it was what his soul had for a long
time longed after ; and he was ready, even at the expense
of the last drop of his blood, to make the experiment."
“ Then, honest Will," said I, “if I am not very much
mistaken, I have at last found one, and which I do not
in the least doubt, by our prudent management, will
answer both our expectations, even without our losing
any blood about the matter ; " telling him every particular
wherein it consisted, and which he also approved of
greatly, alleging the only difficulty to be our procuring
of a third person that might be trusted, for that two
were not sufficient to work the vessel and steer her well
over to the Spanish shore, or to any other coast, in case
the winds would not permit us to go thither. “Well,
Will,” said I, “cannot you tell where to look out for
such a one ?” “ Yes," said he, “I could soon name
one, but I cannot altogether answer for his fidelity,
though I never heard anything to the contrary of his
being an honest man.” “Very well," said İ, “ name
him, and then we will consult further whether he may
be trusted ;” and then he told me it was William
Johnston, his comrade, a Kentish man. “Very well,"
said I, “ then let us not trouble our heads about any
other till we have at a distance proved him ;" which we
instantly went about, and on our finding him very desirous
to make his escape, we (on his swearing secrecy) let him
into it, and which he seemed very highly to approve of,
and eagerly pressed the execution.
So having consulted and agreed on the means, we were
the next night fully determined to put it into execution, and
hich we ordered after the following manner: I, having, as
aforesaid, very highly ingratiated myself with the two Moors,

and taking with me a bottle of brandy, went down to the
landing-place; and where I had not been but a very little
time before they had from the vessel (which was not more
than a hundred yards off the shore) discovered me, and
came with their boat directly to me, thinking (as they
said) I had a mind to go again on board. I told them,
“No, for that I had then only borrowed so much time as
to be as good as my word with them," seeming to be in
an extreme hurry; then privately conveying them the
bottle, I turned me about to be again going off, as if I
had for that time nothing further to say to them; when
they, calling to me and expressing their gratitude in
hearty thanks, I turned me round again, and said, “ Poor
hearts, I wish with all my heart it had been a greater
quantity; but that you know would at this time of day
have been very dangerous to bring; therefore, if you will
come to-morrow night by ten of the clock, I will meet you
here, and bring with me some more brandy, sugar, and
lemons, and (if you please) two of my comrades, as
honest cocks as any in Barbary, and we will go on board
together and heartily enjoy ourselves.” Which they
seemed very highly to approve of, and earnestly desired
that I would not fail in it.
Now is my heart by far more light, seeing myself, as it
were, already safely landed on some Christian shore, flying
to my comrades with the news, who seemed therewith (and
especially Johnston) no less pleased than myself; and that
night and the next day we got all our little matters in
readiness, as two pair of pistols, the brandy, &c., and the
time appointed for the boat's coming just at hand; when
Johnston, to my very great surprise, told us he could not
by any means go that night. However, Hussey and I went,
and found the Moors just landed, telling them that as we
had good reason to believe there were then some people on

the watch, we had deferred our going on board till the next
night; however, in point of good manners, we had brought
them a couple of bottles of brandy, sugar and lemons,
which we thought ourselves obliged to, rather than to
suffer them to wait our coming in vain. And with which
they were, no doubt, highly delighted, telling us, after a
most pleasing manner, that they would go on board and
drink our healths, and that we might depend on their
coming again the next night; as indeed they did, but
Johnston again disappointing us, we could not then go with
them no more than the night before. Therefore, after
thanking them for their civility, desiring them to accept of
a couple of bottles more of brandy, &c., and telling them,
that when we saw the way clear we would give them notice,
we parted, they again on board to make merry, and we on
the contrary back to our loathed apartments, in a very dis-
satisfied mood, though resolving, before we let loose our
rage, to lay us down, if we could, to compose ourselves.
But alas ! sleep fled us, rising again at daybreak as we lay
down, without so much as closing our eyes; when we went
directly to Johnston, taking him aside, and telling him,
that in an affair of that nature, to do as he had done, was
using both us and himself very ill ; and which, had he
gone about as heartily, as he promised, we should in all
likelihood have been then safely landed on some Christian
shore, quite out of the power of the Moors, and with a
rich prize, to the value at least of five or six thousand
pounds, in our possession. This might, in some measure,
make us a compensation for our so long and grievous cap-
tivity; and as the opportunity was still in our power, we
hoped he would mend all, by going heartily about it that
night. To which he, after a short pause, answered, “That
he had again considered maturely of the affair himself, and
that he found it to be quite different from what it had first

appeared to him ; therefore we should urge it to him no
further, for that it was only a foolish whimsey come into
our heads, impossible to be executed ; and for which, if we
did not desist, he would inform the Governor. “Why,
thou vile villain," said I, “thou can'st not surely be in
good earnest.” “No," said he, “but indeed I am," and
confirmed it with many horrid oaths ; when I, being quite
overcome with passion, could no longer forbear him, but
directly drew my sword, and gave him a very deep cut
across his face, which I verily thought, and really hoped,
had done his business, at least so far as that it might not
be in his power to tell any tales. However, the dog
recovered; but let him come home when he will, I war-
rant he will bring with him the mark, which I told his
sister, who was with me in the river of London, inquiring
if I had seen him in Barbary ; together with what it was
that he complained of to the Governor about me; how I
got off, and him confined close prisoner? For after my
giving him this shrewd cut (which I must own to be
intended in another manner), he went directly to the
Governor, holding his wound so close together as he could
(though bleeding prodigiously), complaining against me,
and telling my reasons for serving him so. And then I
was forth with ordered before the Governor by a file of
musketeers, who offering to lay hold on me, I put them by,
telling them that they should not, at their peril, lead me
like a dog, for that I had done nothing anywise deserving
of such usage. However, if they would walk on before,
I would follow them; and which they consenting to, I was
soon before the Governor, who looking at me very fiercely,
and turning up the white of his eyes sullenly, told me
that he never thought me to be so much a villain, always
having had of me before a very high opinion; that he
thought I would be the last person guilty of such an

action. “Pray, sir,” said I, “ of what action ?” “Of
what action ?” said he. “Why you know already better
than myself; and therefore I do not see what occasion
there is of my repeating it. However, since you plead
ignorance, I desire to know what could induce you to cut
Johnston across the face.” “As to my cutting him across
the face," said I, “I cannot deny; and as to the induce-
ment, I was only sorry that it had not ended his days."
“A very pretty inducement indeed,” said he, "to kill a
man, for not joining with you in your wicked design in
running away with the sloop and cargo.” “I run away
with the sloop and cargo,” said I; “the villain could not
have the impudence to say so!” “No," said he, “but he
will say it to your face, and you shall be punished in a way
deserving of so notorious a crime," ordering the guards
to carry me directly off, and to put me into safe custody.
When I humbly entreating to be heard, and that before
he let loose his rage he would be pleased to inquire into the
truth of this second part of Johnston's story, it being quite
reverse and notoriously false, he asked me what I could say
to justify myself. I told him I could say enough to con-
vince him, and all other impartial judges, of my innocence ;
and which, if I did not make very plainly to appear, by
most undeniable evidence, he should proceed against me,
and I was willing to undergo such punishment as the
nature of the case deserved, and his Excellency should
think fit to inflict; and that in order thereunto, he would
be pleased to suffer Johnston to be confronted, and in both
our presence to examine such evidence as should be by me
produced.
On this Johnston was directly ordered forth, and
soon appeared in a terrible condition; and being asked
if I had not often prompted him to run away with the
sloop and cargo, and if I had not, on his refusing to join

me in so foul an action, given him that cut, he as well as
he could answered in the affirmative. At which the Gover-
nor, looking again at me very fiercely, said, “Now are not
you a very pretty fellow ?" I told him yes, and that when
he had heard my evidence, I did not doubt but what he
would think me so in good earnest; and for me to tell him
myself that he had the word only of a perjured villain,
who would not stick to say anything, even to the prejudice
of his own father, so he might thereby accomplish his
wicked designs, would signify nothing. Not but he had
most basely reversed the story, himself being the only
aggressor ; for that he had of a long time back continually
teazed me to join with him in escape, and very particularly
during the last three days, concerning the sloop; and at
last, finding that notwithstanding my often denials and
representations I could not be at quiet for him, and his so
wicked importunities, I gave him the cut. And of all which,
if his Excellency doubted, I could make most undeniable
proof, by means of another person, whom he also prompted
to the same undertaking. “Indeed!” said the Governor.
“What may the person's name be?” I told him William
Hussey." “And can you produce him," said he. “Yes,
sir," said I, “I can, for he is one of the people who came
with me from Fez for the carriages, and cannot be far off,
but very likely in the yard with the carpenters, where my
men generally, by my orders, gave their attendance.”
Then a messenger was sent for him, and soon returned,
and Hussey with them, Johnston being all this time, no
doubt, in a fearful condition, it being then too late for him
to bring in Hussey for a party ; through which omission,
Hussey's evidence carried with it by far the greater weight,
and he had his lesson, as you may suppose, at his tongue's
end, though he said never a word till he was by the Gover-
nor asked if he knew anything concerning Johnston's
me.

wound, and of the party giving it? When he answered
yes, it was Pellow, and that if I had not given it, he had
fully designed to have given it himself. “Pray,” said the
Governor, " for what reason ?” “For what reason, sir,"
said he, "for reason enough, I think; and no doubt, when
I have told you the truth of the story, you will also allow
it.” “Very well," said he, "proceed, and let me know the
very truth of the matter. “Then the matter, sir, in short
is even this :-Johnston and myself are soldiers, you must
know, under Pellow's command, and therefore consequently
generally together; and for a long time back I have not
been at quiet, on Johnston's frequent importuning me to
join with him in escape, and very particularly since coming
to Sallee, in carrying off a certain sloop; alleging that
Pellow had already given his word, and that if I would
likewise consent to it, it would be strength sufficient. This,
sir, I must confess very much surprised me, I having
always found Pellow very easy under his present condition;
and as not knowing what such falsities might tend to, I
could not be quiet till I had it either confirmed or denied
from Pellow's own mouth, and for which I this morning
found an opportunity, and told Pellow in Johnston's hear-
ing what he had said of him. Indeed (said Pellow, in a
very great surprise), Will, had not I a very good opinion of
you, I should have no small difficulty with myself to believe
it; and now I cannot very well tell what to make of it, it
being, I think, almost impossible for any one to invent
such an abominable falsity, looking sternly at Johnston,
and asking him if it was true ; to which he making no
answer, Pellow asked him what he meant by it, thus (the
better to colour his so wicked designs) to make use of his
name; at which Johnston being so confounded that he
could make no answer, Pellow said, “You dog, you are
going the right way to take away my life ; tell me what

could induce you to it, or if ever I had any discourse with
you tending to the affair. Speak, had I, or had I not?'
And being still silent, Pellow drew his sword and gave him
the cut; and this, sir, is the very truth of the matter."
Here the Governor was silent for some time, looking very
fiercely at Johnston, and at last telling him that he could
not imagine how he could invent such a damnable lie! and
which, had not Providence interposed, by Hussey's being
let into the secret, must in all likelihood have taken away
the life of an innocent person, ordering the guards to carry
him off and put him in irons. As for me, their atten-
dance on me was no longer necessary, for that I had
sufficiently cleared myself, and that I was again at liberty
to depart when and where I would.
Now having overreached Johnston, and for his villainy
procured him a close prison, and of which I think he was
in more respects than one highly deserving, and which (as
proper for the keeping the knowledge of the affair from the
public whereby it might probably spread and reach the
Emperor's ears) was, I think, the fittest place for him.
However, to prevent all this, I humbly desired the Gover-
nor to pardon him, and that he might in the prison be
taken care of, and cured of his wound, and that the matter
might be all hushed. For notwithstanding he had so dealt
by me, yet would not I on any account, as I was then so
far in the Emperor's good graces, that he should know it,
thereby to give him any uneasiness, or the least doubt of
my fidelity. “Therefore, pray, sir," said I, " forgive him,
and be pleased to accept of the small matters in this purse,
as an acknowledgment of so great a favour:" giving him
forty gold ducats (which I had been a long time before
scraping together), and which he very greedily accepted of,
telling me, with a pleased countenance, to keep my own
secrets, and all should be well.

And here, before I proceed any further, I shall, by way
of a short digression, ask my readers if they think we
used Johnston in anywise ill, or otherwise than they would
have done, had it been their own case, unless by my extra-
ordinary care of him, after he was made a prisoner, which
I think to be no way suitable to his deserts, notwithstanding
our so wrongfully turning the tables upon him; therefore,
I say, the nature of the case being duly considered, and
when I tell them that it prolonged my captivity eight
years, I hope my treatment of him will be rather approved
of than censured. Though Hussey was so lucky to get off
in a short time after, and he has, I am sure, gratitude
enough to acknowledge that I was therein very instru-
mental, though it was not my fortune (I having yet a
much longer and very severe servitude to encounter with)
to go with him, he getting with success to Marcegongue,
and thence in a Portuguese ship to Lisbon. But to
return.
The carriages being all now finished, and all of us
ordered to be at the next morning in readiness to depart,
I that night waited on the Governor, to thank him for all
his past favours, and to intreat his future remembrance of
my so late misfortunes, and as Johnston was not then able
to undergo the journey, he would order such care of him
as to send him after us, so soon as he was; not that I ever
desired to see him any more, but in case he might happen
to be required at our hands, we might know where to find
him ; though indeed he never after cared to come where I
was, neither did I see him but very seldom.
Now are we on the road with the carriages, having with
us a sufficient number of the inhabitants from Sallee, to
the next town, and so from town to town, relieving one
another till we got well to the camp, and where I was by
Muley Hamet most kindly received, and told by him that

he had an account from Bashaw Belide Showey, of my
readiness in following him from Tessent, in order to assist
him in his restoration at Mequinez, and that he would
always have a kind remembrance thereof. And now are
our cannon all mounted, and for a month's time we kept
almost a continual battery upon the town; and though I
had the good fortune to escape hitherto unwounded, yet
was it my mishap soon after, the malcontents sallying, to
receive two musket shots within a minute's time of each
other, one passing through my right thigh, and the other
through my left shoulder, and at such a time as I had but
the moment before received a shrewd cut in my left hand,
and disengaged myself from a party fighting sword in hand.
And now am I in a bloody condition, I being tapped in
three several places, insomuch that from my excessive loss
of blood from them all, I really thought that I could not
have long survived it; and thought the wound in my hand
might not be in anywise reckoned dangerous as the others,
yet could not the surgeons prevent its bleeding little or
more for three days, though they staunched the others in
a very little time.
Now am I laid on a bier, in order to be carried to an
hospital in New Fez, for the better conveniency of cure; and
which Muley Hamet seeing, he rode forth, and asked who
I was, and after being told, he said he was very sorry for
me, and that it was his pleasure I should be particularly
taken care of, and ordered three surgeons to go along with
me, and to use the best of their skill for my recovery, and
a Genoese servitor to be always in my apartment with
me, giving me out of his jibbera,* or purse (which he had
generally hanging at bis saddle before him), fifty gold
ducats, and strictly charging that I should have a quarter

of fresh mutton brought in every day, or anything else the
surgeons should approve of for my subsistence. Then,
after wishing me well, he turned from me, and my bearers
proceeded ; and they had not carried me far before a Moor
(just arrived in the camp from Agoory) stepped forth,
telling me that he was sorry to see me in that condition,
that he hoped my wounds were not mortal, and so forth ;
that though he never cared to be the bearer of ill news,
yet he could not forbear telling me that my wife and
daughter were both very lately dead, dying within three
days one of the other. One of Job's comforters indeed !
though I must own that it gave me very little uneasiness,
as I thought them to be by far better off than they could
have been in this troublesome world, especially this part of
it; and I was really very glad that they were delivered out
of it, and therefore it gave me very little uneasiness.

condition, and my spirits sunk to that degree that I really

by way of my Genoese attendant borrowed a point of the
law I must actually have been dead in a very little time, it
being otherwise impossible for me to get over it. For not-
withstanding I was so miserably low, and my so often
telling my surgeons of it, yet would not they allow me to
drink anything stronger than water.
Therefore I, considering my own case, told my keeper
(whom I knew to be a trusty person) if he did not
instantly look out for some comfortable wine for me, or
something that was stronger by way of cordial, I could
hold it but very little longer. Therefore, said I, pray
hasten and see what you can do for me, giving him a
gold ducat, with which he departed, and was in a very
little time back again with two leather bottles concealed
under his robe, the one full of brandy, and the other
of excellent old Malaga wine, with which I that night
made pretty free, drinking, I believe, of both sorts, as a be-
ginning, about a pint, and slept after it a hearty nap, I not
having shut my eyes before from the time I was wounded.
At my awaking I found myself another man, my spirits
being to that degree exhilarated that never was there a
more sudden and surprising alteration; and then I took
another moderate tiff, by which I was soon again composed,
and slept till the next morning sunrising, when my German
came to look at and dress my wounds, asking me how I
felt myself, and if I had taken any rest. I told him, yes, I
had slept many hours, and that I found myself very much
revived. “Very well,” said he, “I am glad of it with all
my heart.” “But sir," said I, "I hope you will be pleased
to allow me something by way of cordial, to cheer my
spirits, for you cannot but suppose them, after so great a
loss of blood, to be very low." "Well,” said he, “I will
consider of it, but first let me feel your arm wrist,"
when he, starting back as one in a very great surprise,

“Something," says he,“ to raise your spirits; why your
spirits are now ten times higher than they were yesterday,
therefore I hope there will be no occasion for any spirituous
liquors, and I very heartily wish there may not, it being
the most dangerous thing in the world ; therefore,” said
he, “I would by all means have you to content yourself
without it till to-morrow, and if I find any further occasion
for it then than I do at this time, I give you my honour to
procure some for you, and to trust to yours for the event.”
I told him it was very well, and that I should be thereby
highly obliged to him, desiring him to look at my wounds.
To which he answered me that he would willingly first
stay a little longer, for that he every moment expected his
brethren-who indeed came in a very little time after, and
by consent fell to opening the bandage, and after a very
short time looking at that in my shoulder (which, as being
80 near my heart, they thought to be by far the most
dangerous), they in a very pleasing manner told me that
they had never before seen, in so short a time, so great an
alteration for the better, for whereas it was the day before
inflamed to a very high degree, it was then wonderfully
altered, and the inflammation almost quite off ; and then
they looked at the other two and found them the same, so
after dressing me they, having many other patients to go
to, departed together. But the German coming hastily back
again told me that he really thought my wounds to be in a
very promising way, and so it would be mere madness in
me to drink any spirituous liquors till the inflammation
was quite over, and they had brought them to a better
matter; and which, if I did, it would not only be the un-
doing of what they had hitherto done for me, but put it out
of the power of all the surgeons in Barbary to cure me.
“Well,” said I, with a sigh, “I remember you told me so
before," and then he left me, but he was not gone out of

the room two minutes before I and my attendant drank
each of us a bumper to his good health, and between us,
before night, finished all the wine, burning most of it with
sugar and spices, which threw me into a gallant sweat and
sound sleep. In this I continued the best part of that
day, and at night had our wine bottle replenished again,
when I took another hearty tiff, and fell again into a sound
sleep, napping it in and out till six of the clock the next
morning, when my surgeons came in a full body to dress
my wounds, which they instantly went about, and still
found them growing better in a surprising manner, saying
that the inflammation was quite off, and there was a very
good digestion, asking me if I did not find my spirits to be
very much restored. I told them yes, to a very high
degree. “Well," said the German, “keep but a good
heart, and never fear of a cure in a little time," and after
telling me in a low voice he would bring me some wine the
next morning, he departed with his brethren.
Now is my stomach again craving after meat, and soon
began to relish it tolerably well, eating a good mess of
mutton broth two or three times a day, and which, with
the continuance of my wine, and a good bowl of cuscassoo
now and then, I found to bring me on apace. My German

robe, after sending my attendant out of the room, he asked
me if I would venture to take a tiff. I told him yes, if he
pleased, with all my heart. “Then," said he, “ here, take
the bottle and drink," giving it into my hand, though
after it had been but a very short time at my mouth he
cried out, “Hold ! hold ! you have drunk enough," when
I took it off, telling him that I thought it to be very
excellent wine, and that I found it very comfortable.
Well,” said he, “ don't you by any means make too free

with it, but now and then take a little by way of cordial,"
to which I had but just time to tell him that it was very
well, and hid the bottle in my bed-clothes, before my other
surgeons came in, and fell to opening my wounds; still
finding them for the better, and soon again left me, when
I fell to work with the doctor's bottle, and which (as being
but a quart) my attendant and I drank clear out that same
day, designing no longer to impose upon my benefactor,
but to bring him in the next morning, if I could, for a third
man; and when he, coming again before any of the rest,
very opportunely asked me how the wine had agreed with
me, and if I thought it had done me no harm, “ Harm!”
said I, “no, no, but has, I think, on the contrary done me
a great deal of good, and which, if I had more of it, you
would as well as myself soon find to be true, and to work
a perfect cure on me in a very little time." “ Some more
of it!" said he, in a seeming surprise, “why you have not,
I hope, finished all I brought you yesterday." “ Indeed,
sir,” said I, “I have, and, to be plain with you, a great
deal more, or I should not be now here to tell you so."
“Now here," said he, “ to tell me so; in short, that you
are is the greatest miracle." And when I told him the
real truth, how much I had drank, the benefit I had
received by it, and how I must have been inevitably dead
without it, “Well," said he, “ God is all sufficient, but of
all the ways I ever saw or heard of curing wounds before,
yours is the most uncommon one."
Then I called to my attendant to bring forth one of
our own bottles, and drank a hearty tiff to my doctor's
good health, delivering him the bottle, and he as heartily
pledged me, telling me that he thought it to be very
excellent wine, and that he was very glad it had so well
agreed with me; however, he believed that nobody be-
fore had ever been that way cured. “Oh, doctor," said

ADVENTURES OF THOMAS PELLOW. 181
I, "you are in that very much mistaken, I having many
times before made the experiment on myself.” “Very
well," said he, “I hope all this is under the rose."
“Yes, yes, doctor," said I, “ that you need not fear, and if
you will be pleased to come in with us for a third man we
may innocently enjoy ourselves over a bottle, without doing
any harm to anybody else.” “Very well,” said he, “I
understand you, and as to my answer I will give it you in
the evening." His comrades coming in at once upon us, we
had not time then to talk any further about it, and after
they had dressed me, and told me that my wounds were
bettering apace, they again for that day left me.
And now is my German doctor soon about to come in for
a snack. Coming at the beginning of the night, when all
was pretty quiet, and bringing with him two bottles of
excellent old Malaga wine, he sat down, took a cup out of
his pocket, filled it to the top, and drank it off to the good
health of our Christian friends, myself and my attendant
following his example; and after we had drank a round or
two more, he told me that he thought I might think myself
very happy under my present circumstances, and to be much
better off than a great number of my comrades, who,
during my lying sick, had been exposed to many dangers
and hardships, and a great many of them slain. Of which,
indeed, I had before repeated advices, and therefore my life
was in all likelihood entirely owing to my wounds, and
which, indeed, was very likely to be true, for during my
cure were many thousands on both sides slain, and amongst
them of my small number at least one hundred and fifty.
Now are my wounds healing apace, being able again to
sit up and walk a little, and my strength every day very
apparently increasing, insomuch that my surgeons told me
that they did not doubt but that I might in three weeks
more be again in a capacity to return to my duty in the

army. Though indeed I thought myself fit at the fortnight's
end, and should certainly have made my appearance then
had not they prevented me, telling me that they thought
my wound to be still too green, and not sufficiently
hardened, and therefore I was obliged to remain there
another week; at the end of which I waited with my sur-
geons on Muley Hamet, who seemed to be highly pleased
at my recovery, and thereof gave my surgeons very liberal
acknowledgments, ordering me immediately back again to
my old apartment. For as the malcontents were then
reduced to the lowest ebb, he said he could not see what
service I could be of there, and after making most humble
acknowledgment for his so very great care of me, I obeyed
his orders, went back, and there continued six days longer,
at the end of which he sent me word by one of my own
people that the city had surrendered, and that it was his
pleasure I should come directly and see the rebels march
out; which, so well as they were able, I soon did, being
really all of them reduced to a very miserable condition.
Yet, notwithstanding, many of them (especially their ring-
leaders) had their heads chopped off on the spot, and
Abdemeleck, with forty principal men, were put into safe
custody, in order to be safely conducted by the army to
Mequinez.
Before Abdemeleck was brought into Hamet Deby's pre-
Bence he was searched by the captain of his guards and
some other officers, who found a poniard and a small pistol
concealed in his pockets, which they took away, and then
conducted him into Hamet Deby's tent, who, instead of
venting his wrath and vengeance upon him, contented

sharpness. “What,” says he, "after having taken the
crown from me, are you now cruel enough to seek to take
away my life ?"

Now have we a general muster, by which we found we had
lost in all on our side in this siege thirty thousand men;
then we struck our tents, and with the remainder of our
army marched with our prisoners to Mequinez, where the
forty principal men were beheaded in the market-place,
which was a much milder fate than those met with who
were before taken in Mequinez, for there the governor of
the city and some of the principal men were nailed by
their hands and feet to one of the gates of the city, in which
miserable manner they lived three days, except the governor
of the city, whose hands and feet were so torn by the weight
of his body (being a lusty man) that he fell down from the
gate some time after he had been nailed thereto, upon
which they had the mercy to dispatch him with their
sabres. And at this time, indeed, the Emperor ordered the
Governor of Sallee to be served in the same or worse
manner, for he had first bis skull cracked with the blows
of a pistol, and was then hung up by the feet at one of the
gates of the city, in which deplorable condition he remained
alive four days.
Abdemeleck was put under the custody of Emshael,* the
black Bashaw, who was strictly charged to keep him close
prisoner in his own house till further orders ; and indeed
he never got free from thence, being at the end of six weeks
strangled by two of his own brothers; and lest he might
not be dead enough, they gave him each a stab with their
long murdering knives through his body, Muley Hamet Deby
dying about an hour before him. His death was occasioned
-as was by all supposed-by his drinking a small bowl of
milk at his entrance into Mequinez from Fez-according
to custom, after obtaining any signal victory-it being
poisoned by Muley Abdallah's mother, in order to clear
her son's way to the Empire, he languishing from the very

moment of his taking it, even to his last hour. Muley
Abdallah was accordingly proclaimed as soon as Hamet
Deby was dead, his mother Lela Coneta, who had been
one of the wives of Muley Swine, or Ishmael, having-by
distributing three hundred thousand ducats amongst the
Black Army, besides fifty thousand given by her own hands
to their chief officers-engaged them in his interest, not-
withstanding Hamet Deby left a son named Muley Bouser, *
who was capable of reigning, whom Muley Abdallah kept
in prison some time, but he at last found an opportunity
to escape.
Now am I to prepare myself for swimming through a
fresh sea of blood, the scene opening in new and deeper
colours indeed, for though Muley Abdallah was in my time
driven out twice, yet was there scarce a day passed without
his murdering some of his subjects, more or less; he
having, I believe, killed with his own hands, besides those
most unmercifully butchered by the hands of his execu-
tioners, at least fifty thousand men, he having his old
father the devil so riveted in his heart, as that it was im-
possible for anybody to tell when he was in jest or in
earnest, being always bent on bloody enterprises, and
unhappy I, seldom exempted from making one therein—I
mean in his inhumane bloody wars. But I was for the
present sent again to my old station at Agoory, and where
I had a short interval of about six weeks, often reflecting
on the loss of my wife and daughter; for though I said
before their death gave me very little uneasiness, yet could
not I help now being under concern for them, and especially
the child, who always used, at my coming home wounded,
to clasp her little arms about my neck, hugging and be-
moaning her poor father, and telling me that I should no
more go into the wars, for that she and her mother

would go with me to England, and live with her grand-
mother:
These reflections, I say, gave me some concern ; however,
I soon endeavoured to forget them, for, in short, what
could I do? To bring them back again I knew was im-
possible, and as they were—as far as lay in my power-
instructed in the knowledge and, I hope, true belief in
Christ, and my intentions were fully bent upon escape, I
was really glad that they were dead; and I plainly told
myself that as I could find in my heart in their lifetime to
endeavour to leave the country, I had now no room left
for excuse, but ought to pursue it; and therefore I was
thoroughly resolved to lay hold of all opportunities, and
as soon as my strength was a little better restored again,
to push all for all. My resolutions thus settled, I am
again at peace with myself, diligently employing my time
in bathing my wounds with such ointments as my doctors
had directed me.
But I was again on a sudden ordered, with all my
men, for Mequinez ; and though I was in a very indif.
ferent condition, sore against my inclinations, and full
two of the clock in the afternoon when my orders
came, yet was I obliged to obey them, and to be there, if
possibly I could, that same day; and which, though very
short notice, it being in the month of July, I punctually
performed, we being all on horseback by four, and without
any hurry got to Mequinez in good season, where I found
Muley Abdallah at the head of an army consisting of
140,000 men, chiefly blacks, ready to march for Old Fez.
With whom we were joined, and early the next morning
marched with them, the malcontents having gathered
together there, refusing to acknowledge him, and yet setting
up no one else ; so that I verily believe it was merely for
the sake of rebellion, and I easily foresaw that, if they

chose to be obstinate, their blood would be poured out like
water; and I must own I heartily wished—seeing they
were of so cruel a nature—that their insatiate eyes might
be never satisfied with blood, till the last of them had seen
the last drop of all the rest, himself expiring with the
utter extermination of that so barbarous and most un-
christian monarchy. And which is, indeed, now in a very
fair way of being accomplished, they having a most in-
satiate thirst after each other's destruction, attended with
sad devastation and famine, and the times still growing
worse and worse upon their hands; and which may God
continue, till they are either brought to a true sight of their
errors, or the utter extirpation of themselves and principles.
For as their country is so very rich, spacious, and popu-
lous, it is much to be regretted that it should go under any
other denomination than that of a part of a Christendom;
and whereto should all Christian princes but set their
helping hand, Christianity would not only flourish and
abound, but many poor ignorant souls who are now,
through means of their following false lights, in a most
dangerous and deplorable condition, be in a little time
brought by the light of the Gospel into a true knowledge
and belief in Christ, and to the utter abhorrence and
detestation of Mahometism; which, through the ambitious
artifices of cunning and designing men, hath for so many
ages been so grossly imposed upon them.—But whither
am I wandering ? These digressions are quite out of my
way, as well as a subject far beyond my abilities, and
altogether out of my way to meddle with; therefore I
shall again return to my old road, travel gently on, and
leave the event of all these things to God; who, no
doubt, hath in a great measure ordained them for wise
purposes.
Now am I again one in this large army before Old Fez,

where Muley Abdallah offered the malcontents free pardon,
in case they would surrender, and promise future obedience
to him. To which they answered, being but too well ac-
quainted with his deceitful nature, that, considering their
resistance was for liberty and property, they thought it as
good or much better for them to die then, than at another
time; therefore they utterly despised his offer, which they
directly confirmed from the mouths of their muskets.
And now is the bloody scene opening apace, nothing but
death and horror reigning here for the space of seven
months, during which I was not backward in acting my
part even in place of greatest danger, -insomuch that I
was very willing-in case I might escape with my life—to
compound for a smart wound or two; and which, indeed,
was both my bad and good hap, as you will by and by hear.
Now is there scarce a day without close skirmishing,
and on both sides great slaughter; and notwithstanding
our cruel treatment of those we took alive, as unmercifully
cutting some to pieces, and hanging others up alive by
the heels, till they were dead through anguish and hunger,
and others by many other cruel inventions of tortures, and
all within sight of the garrison, yet did they seem to make
no manner account of it, unless growing thereat more
desperate. And which, indeed, by their future behaviour
and bold attempts of reprisals, they made soon to be very
apparent, behaving to the last with an undaunted resolu-
tion, selling their blood with their lives, to the very great
expense of that of our army. Had not their provisions
and warlike stores failed them, they had certainly done
us far greater mischief, we having from several prisoners
repeated accounts that, as long as their stores lasted and
people continued, they were thoroughly resolved to hold it
out. But when their provision was exhausted, their horses
had eaten up all their provender, and they at last eaten

up their horses, the remnant were resolved to sally forth
together, and sell their lives at the rate of those of the
bravest soldiers, which they deemed much better, and by
far more honourable, than to drag a miserable life, attended
with grievous servitude, and continually exposed to the
capricious humour of a bloody tyrant.
Therefore they were resolved to deliver their country
from his tyranny, or perish with it. And in which, indeed,
they were in a great measure as good as their words, for
they fought us to the last with a noble resolution, and
desperately sallied so long as they had anything remaining
whereby to support their sinking spirits, their horses being
at last all eaten up, and the remnant of themselves so
miserably weak through famine, that their lives were scarce
worth the taking, not having strength enough left them to
make an honourable pile for burial, which was what they
fully intended, and, like Samson, to have killed more at
their deaths than they had before done during all the time
of their lives.
But as their strength could do no more, they were at last
obliged to submit to the mercy of a merciless tyrant,
marching out, or rather, indeed, crawling out—as being
scarce able to stand-in one body of six thousand and
thirty-six. The 36 were instantly on the spot beheaded,
and the remaining 6,000 led by the army in a miserable
condition to Mequinez, and ever after exposed (so long as
any of them remained) in the fronts of the tyrant's bloody
battles, and most of them were killed in my sight. This
was my third battle at Fez. We lost 40,000 men ; and of
1,500 Christians in this siege and the former, no more
remained than 660, myself being likewise wounded by two
musket shots in my left shoulder and fleshy part of my
buttock, though these wounds did not keep me from my
duty more than five weeks.

Now am I, after this my so very great fatigue and
narrow escape of my life, sent again to Agoory, where I
could not again help thinking on my late wife and little
prattler, ruminating on the many hazards I had hitherto
undergone, and the no less miraculous preservations I had
met with, fully intending to pursue my intentions of
escaping, and to put my trust in Providence for de-
liverance, as soon as my wounds were somewhat hardened,
my strength restored, and a convenient opportunity should
offer.
But alas ! I may as to that set my heart at quiet for
some very considerable time longer, I having first many
more tedious and hazardous exploits to encounter with.
And first I was by Muley Abdallah, even, as I may say,
before I had time to look about me, very unexpectedly
hurried away on the following expedition. He having
repeated accounts of a great body of malcontents, con-
sisting to the least of 100,000, gathered at Itehuzzan,* in
the province of Itemoor,t and that they behaved after a
most insolent manner, he therefore directly ordered 70,000
horse to be got ready to march with him thither to
correct them, and of which number myself and men, as a
part, were forth with ordered to Mequinez, where we
directly joined the rest of the army and marched towards
the rebels; and the second day following we got to Ite-
huzzan.
Here we soon found the grand assembly bad divided
themselves into several parties, flying before us as fast
as they could into the heights of the mountains, so as
we were at least two months before we could light on them
to any purpose, and then, being driven to many hardships,
they sent to the Emperor twelve of their chiefs, and with

them sixteen fine horses as a present, with full power to
tell him that if in case he would send a small party of his
people back with them, they would so order matters, as
that they should return again in little time with their
respective dues. In order to which he sent with them the
next morning six thousand men, who were treated by them
for some time in a seeming friendly manner, and a great
many of them, in conformity to this offer, accordingly
brought in the tributes, though the greatest part of them,
as not at all liking such heavy impositions, joining in
grand consult, sent thirty-eight of their chiefs to the
Emperor to tell him that they had not as then brought in
their several payments, according to their promise by their
former messengers ; not but they fully intended to do it,
and were then ready to do so, provided he would make an
abatement. At this the tyrant was so enraged, that he
answered them in a most furious manner, “An abatement,
you dogs ! I'll soon make an abatement of you,” looking
at them very fiercely, and beckoning to his own people to
hem them in, and then, on giving a sign, they had all
their heads in a moment cut off, saving one only, who
through wonderful chance escaped to carry this so unex-
pected answer back to their message : and which, for some
time, put the remainder of them into a most terrible con-
sternation, as not thoroughly resolving for a day or two
what course to take; though it was at last agreed by them
to surprise and cut off the six thousand of our people,
who lay encamped near them, and accordingly they fell
directly on them, and notwithstanding they made a gallant
resistance, yet did they kill of them four thousand on the
spot, the other two thousand flying in great confusion back
to our army, with this so unwelcome and unexpected news.
Now is the tyrant most highly enraged, insomuch that
he directly ordered most of us up the mountains on foot,

and to give no quarter to all we could light on ; which was
punctually obeyed, though we found at first but very few
of them, as only here and there a small number tarrying
behind the rest of their brethren, under a pretence of being
shepherds or herdsmen to look after their cattle, the main
body (of about 30,000) flying from mountain to mountain
before us, and so continuing for seven days. On the eighth
day we got so near them, and to that degree so hemmed
them in, that we in a very little time destroyed them,
putting them all to the sword with very little loss on our
side; and then, after breathing some short time, we
marched to the castle of Mint, in the province of
Itehacam,* lying at the foot of a very high mountain, and
wherein we had an account that 50,000 more of the rebels
were entrenched ; and very early the next morning we were
all ordered up on foot, to pay them a visit, and so surrounded
them that we attacked them in their trenches sword in
hand, and in a short time killed of them 30,000 more, the
remainder in great confusion flying before us to the moun.
tain of Ceedeboazzo Multorria, t where they were in such a
manner sheltered from our fury, that it would have been
in us not only a mere madness to follow them, but also
very hazardous, as well as altogether in vain.
Therefore we marched to the river Cuscasoe, f about four
leagues farther on between the mountains, lying between
Ceedeboazzo & and Mint, there intending to settle our camp
for some time; and which was indeed forthwith marked out,
and our tents pitched there; but on the eighth day follow-
ing our camp was very accidentally set on fire by a coal
of fire sticking at the bottom of a cake of bread, just taken
out of a hot oven, which falling amongst the fodder (of
which there was a prodigious quantity, very long and dry)

the fire quickly spread itself to that degree, that notwith-
standing all our haste in removing our tents, &c., yet were
many of them, with several of our horses and all our
stores, burnt, the fire still spreading towards the Emperor's
pavilions, wherein were fifty of his concubines, who were
with great difficulty carried off by the eunuchs, covered all
over with cloaks, and shrieking after a dismal manner,
before the fire reached them.
Now are we, on account of this sad accident, both as to
our provision and ammunition, in a very great strait, and
there was very little dependence of having a fresh supply
from the country, any further than what we got by foraging.
Therefore we were obliged to send expressly to Mequinez for
such as we wanted, and which was full twenty days before
it came to our hands; though during this (after the fodder
was all burnt up, the fire extinguished, and all the ashes
cleared off, for fear of a second accident of like nature) we
settled the remainder of our tents, which we had preserved
from the flames, again in the same place.
Our stores, &c., being arrived, we rose with our army,
and marched out in four days to the castle of Cassavah
Amarisu,* in the parish of Juzob, in the province of
Tamnsnah, after the following route: The first day to
the other side of the river Melhah : the second to Mer-
saidore t; the third to Zeebedah ; and the fourth, by three
o'clock in the afternoon, within two leagues of the castle.
Here we met with a great party of the malcontents; and
though they were double our number, we forth with attacked
them, and by ten of the clock that same night cut most of
them off, when we marched on to the castle, and settled
our camp without the walls, where we remained for the
space of two months, ravaging and plundering the country
all round us of their corn, fruit, cattle, &c., after a most

shocking manner, the inhabitants (all but those of the
parish of Meduna) * flying from us into the heights of the
mountains. Indeed it would have been much better for
them had those of Meduna also done so, for notwith-
standing their so ready compliance in sending in to the
tyrant four hundred horse all gallantly mounted with the
prime of their youth, and almost laden with vast sums of
money for his service, yet did he instantly order them for
execution, and had all their heads cut off on the spot. The
rest of the inhabitants in those parts, on seeing this sad
disaster of their neighbours, compounded for their own
lives by bringing in vast sums of money. Then our army
rose, and marched thence with much booty and several
prisoners to Milce,t about six leagues, where we again
pitched our tents, and settled four weeks, still making in
the country grievous havoc. At length we rose and
marched thence, after the following route for Mequinez:
The first day to Invelghummeese ; 1 the second to Inemo-

forthwith with the caravan to the coast of Guinea.
This really gave me some disquiet, as being (I was very
certain) work cut out for me for at least two years. However,
to show any dissatisfaction I knew would not be in the least
availing, and therefore with seeming cheerfulness set out
thence in company with 12,000 camels (our numbers still

died on the passage) safely conducted by an old blind
Laurb in five months' time over this sandy ocean, to the
castle of Shinget. This castle of Shinget belongs to a
better sort of Laurbs, as they are generally termed ;
though I think they are all of them a pack of thievish
bloodthirsty villains, insomuch that whether of them or the
Moors are the better I shall not take upon me to deter-
mine. Though indeed, in the original, I take them to be all
one and the same people, yet is there here a Moorish
governor always residing, and the plunder and tribute is
there brought in during the stay of one caravan on the
Guinea coast till another caravan arrives, and then the
old ones march off with their booty, and leave the new
comers the possession.
In and about this castle was our general rendezvous,
though we marched thrice to the Wadnil, or river Nile,
and all such as made any the least resistance we brought
under subjection with the sword, so that they were either
obliged to bring in the tyrant's exorbitant demands, or
to suffer the severe plundering of the army, stripping
the poor negroes of all they had, killing many of them,
and bringing off their children into the bargain. At
our first coming to the river, we found on it a French vessel
of about eighty tons, and manned by twelve sailors, which
the Moors swam off to, boarded, and hauled to the shore.*
But before I proceed any further, I shall first beg leave to
go back, and tell you of a most extraordinary thing trans-
acted by our old blind pilot, in our travel over the deserts,
into which we being entered about fifty days, during which
we never failed of meeting every day, or every other day
at the furthest, with some very refreshing springs of water,
whereby we and our cattle were very much cherished. At
one of those springs the old man told us that we should
* Note 23.


## p. 197 (#223) ############################################

ADVENTURES OF THOMAS PELLOW. 197
not fail there to fill so many of our skins as would hold
water sufficient for all of us for three days at the least, for
that we should not meet with any more of them during
that time; which we did accordingly, and at the third day's
end we got again to other springs where he told us that
we should not neglect doing the same, for that we should
not for a fortnight meet with water oftener than every third
day; and which, indeed, we did not. However, we passed
over those stages without any great matter of murmuring,
and at the last of them he told us that we should there be
sure to fill all our skins, and let our cattle drink their fill,
for that we should not meet with any more water for some
considerable time, and therefore we should be on our march
as sparing as possible. But the weather being according
to the season of the year (it being in the beginning of
Autumn) exceeding hot, about the sixth day following, we
being about to pour the water out of our skins, to our very
great astonishment found them (or at least the greatest
part of them) quite empty, the excessive heat of the sun
having exhaled the water through the pores of the leather,
insomuch that we to that degree suffered for four days,
that had not our old pilot cheered us in a wonderful manner,
it must certainly have been attended with very ill conse-
quences, it causing amongst us a general murmuring.
But he desired us to be as easy as we could under our sad
distress, for that he was well satisfied we should again in a
short time have water enough, desiring one of our people
to take him up a handful of sand and hold it to his nose;
and after he had snuffed upon it for some short time, he
pleasingly told we should before two days' end reach other
springs, and have water enough, travelling on, and en-
couraging us all in his power.
In the morning of the second day following he desired
that another handful of the sand of that place might

be taken up and held to his nose; on which the party
taking that which he had smelt of two days before (he
having still preserved it in a piece of old linen cloth)
stepped forth and held the same for him to smell to
again; and after he had snuffled on it for a much longer
time than at first, he told him that either the army was
again marching back, or that he had most grossly and
basely imposed on him, for that was actually the same or
some other of the sand of that place he had smelt of two
days before, and therefore he thought him highly to blame,
and that he did very ill thus to go about to deceive a dark
old man. However, it was not in his power, notwithstand-
ing he had so much like a fool endeavoured it. “There-
fore," said he, “throw it away, and on your honour take
me up a handful of the real sand of this place," which,
after just putting his nose to it, he said in a most pleasant
manner, “Now, sirs, this is something like," giving us all
to understand that we should, about four o'clock that after-
noon, have water sufficient; which was, indeed, at this
time as comfortable news to me, as my trusty Genoese
servitor's assurance of procuring me some comfortable
cordials, when I was sick with my wounds at Fez.
About noon he desired a fresh handful of sand, which
putting his nose to, he said, “Ay, ay, this is as it should
be," ordering us to keep a good look out if we could see any
wild beasts, ostriches, eagles, &c., and in such case to tell
him of it; and before we had travelled half a league further
we saw several eagles in the air, and soon after many wild
beasts and ostriches, flocking together on the sand, and on
our telling him of it he told us to march directly thither,
and there we should find several shallow wells of excellent
water, covered over with the skins of wild beasts. “But,"
said he,“ take care you don't disturb it, by pressing on too
eagerly, but go gradually on, and you will find sufficient

for you all; and I further promise to bring you to-morrow
evening to a very large pond, where yourselves and cattle
may all drink at once, and where we may again fill our
skins, so as no more to want water during the remainder
of our journey, for we shall afterwards meet with little or
more every day," At last we got up to these so very much
longed after wells, which we found according to the old
man's assertion; close covered, but soon hauled off the
skins, and all of us, to our very great satisfaction, in course
drank our fill, and then we fell to settling our camp there
for the night, and there being for a good space round, store
of pasture, our cattle were as well off as ourselves.*
By the next morning we were gallantly refreshed; when,
after covering the wells (having first filled our skins with
water, sufficient for that day), we with fresh courage travelled
on, and got that evening, according to promise, to the spacious
pond ; and here being also good store of provender, with
vast numbers of wild beasts, ostriches, &c., we rested two
days, and through means of our old pilot we killed a great
many of them after the following manner. On our seeing
those creatures hankering after the water, and telling our
pilot of it, he ordered us to dig holes in several places
round the pond, deep and large enough to hide two or three
musqueteers in each ; then to draw off the army, when he
said they would come to drink, so as we might shoot them
at our pleasure. After which method we in a little time
killed a great many of them, committing all to pot, as
lions, antelopes, and ostriches together; though I think the
latter by far too good to be thus misused, as being alone
most excellent and delicious eating, and of all other birds
(if it may properly be so called), in the way of serving a
great many people, by far the most preferable, as weighing,
no doubt, at the least two hundred pounds weight, and in

a manner all one lump of fat, so as one of them decently
handled will no doubt suffice two hundred men.
When the native Laurbs are minded to kill an ostrich,
they generally go out in a party, and at a distance surround
him, drawing nearer by degrees, driving him from one to
another till he is at last so tired as that he can seemingly
do no more harm; which, as he cannot fly, may seem to
those who are therewith unacquainted to be a very easy
matter, yet is it, I assure you, a very difficult point. For
when he is pursued, he runs so swiftly as few horses in
Barbary can keep up with him: and when he finds himself
beginning to slacken his pace, and the enemy to gain
ground upon him, he to that degree spurs himself with
his spurs (which he hath growing under his wings, pro-
digious long and sharp) as that he soon again recovers his
pace, bis wings being always extended, and though of no
benefit to him by way of Aying off the ground, yet no
doubt of a very great addition to his speed in running, he
being at last run down much in like nature of a hare before
a pack of hounds, with this difference only, that being
generally close hunting, this altogether in open view.
And now to return to the French vessel ; which, after
taking out some elephants’ teeth and blacks (their gold
being all thrown overboard), was directly burnt, carrying
the prisoners with us to Shinget, four of them dying in the
desert on our way homeward, and the other eight we carried
with us to Mequinez. During our stay on the Guinea
coast, which was in all about twelve months, we got together
a very great booty, as gold, ivory, blacks, &c., though it
did not satisfy our insatiate master, as you will by and by
hear.
Our time being expired, and another caravan arrived,
we packed up our treasure, and set out for Mequinez,
getting well to our old pilot's pond without anything hap-

pening worth my noting, where we again gallantly refreshed
ourselves during the space of two days, regaling on our
wild dainties. And after filling all our skins, we set for-
ward, and got that evening to our so late longed after
wells, where we again took up our quarters, without im.
pairing our main stock of provisions, we have several
ostriches and antelopes, which we brought with us from
the pond for our supper. The next morning at day-
break we were again on the march, myself and six more,
in pursuit of some antelopes, staying about a mile behind
the rest of the caravan ; when all on a sudden we saw
twenty of the wild Laurbs riding on camels towards us,
they having during the caravan's passing by hid them-
selves behind some large sandy banks, of which were here
and there several thrown up by the violent winds, and
again the next storm very likely removed to other places.
The Laurbs being between us and the army, thought no
doubt to have made of us sure prize ; six of them advanced
within a hundred yards of us, and discharged their muskets
on us, one of their shot grazing along the side of my head,
and another wounding a Moor close by my side. On which
we fired at once and killed two of them, when we directly
rode off to charge, and fired at them again, killing the
other four, when again riding off we saw several of our
people coming back to our assistance.
However, before they came up with us, we had fired twice
round on the other fourteen, and killed most of those, and
then we saw many more of their party advancing; though
on their seeing those of our people come back they turned
from us and fled, and lest we might happen to lose sight of
our army we pursued them no further, but hasted forward as
fast as we could. After this skirmish we travelled on un-
molested, taking most special care of our water, so as we
might not be again reduced to so sad & calamity, I riding

as often as I could alongside of the old Laurb, asking him
a great many questions, and particularly concerning his 80
wonderful and surprising knowledge in smelling to the
sand. To which he, after a most courteous manner, answered
me that this was his thirtieth journey over this ocean,
therefore in going and coming his sixtieth time; that in
his last four journeys, finding his sight gradually declining,
he had, by often making the experiment (as having a
wonderful faculty in smelling), attained to this so wonderful
knowledge, he being, he said, well satisfied that the loss
of his sight was thereby in a very great measure compen-
sated, insomuch that he would engage at any time to tell
in what part of the desert he was. One day as I was
riding pretty near him, my camel happened with one of his
feet to hit against something which sounded very hollow,
which I telling the old man of, as wondering what it should
be, he told me it was a mummy. “A mummy,” said I,
“pray what is that?” “It is," said he, “ a human corpse,
which hath for some time lain buried in the sands, till
through the excessive heat thereof it is dried to a kecks ;
and if our surgeons knew it, they would not suffer it (if they
thought it fit for their purpose) to lie any longer there.” “Fit
for their purpose," said I. “What, is one of them better
than another ?” “That,” said he, “is according to the time
of their being buried, or of their being more or less dried."
“ Well, father," said I, “if I should be so lucky to light
on another, I think I should have curiosity enough to take
it up.” And riding again the next day near the old man,
he bade me to get off my camel, for that his camel had with
one of his feet struck against a mummy; which, by his
directions, I with the point of my sword soon found, and
with a spade digged it up in a little time. It was as hard
as a stock-fish, had all its limbs and filesh (though shrivelled)
entire, all the teeth firm in the gums; and as to its being

any way nauseous, a man might without offence have even
carried it in his bosom.
After this, we travelled on without anything else happen-
ing particular, till we safely arrived at Tedlab, where we
found Muley Abdallah waiting our coming, diverting the
time in plundering the country, and murdering his subjects.
And after he had strictly examined into the value of our
treasure, he being not at all pleased with it (though no
doubt it was to the value of some millions of English
pounds sterling), killed Monsore, our Bashaw, and seventeen
more of our principals, with his own hand, and the next
day twenty-seven chiefs, who came thither to him in all
humility from several parts of the country with their
presents, and, to my most unspeakable grief, my deliverer
from the bloody knife at Assamoor.
When the tyrant was glutted with blood, we marched with
him at our head to Mequinez; whence, after the caravan was
separated and sent home to their respective habitations, I
was again at the end of six weeks hurried away on the follow-
ing expedition :-The tyrant having repeated advices of a
vast number of credulous poor souls being (through the
means of one Enseph* or Joseph Haunsell, a noted conjurer)
stirred up to rebellion in and about Tedlah, he having
before shown many of his magic pranks, and had then so
far insinuated into the giddy multitude as to make them
believe they should be invulnerable from Muley Abdallah's
shot, and suchlike stuff, and they pinning their faith so
far on his sleeve, that they were gathered in a little time
to a body of at least two hundred thousand men, doing
even as he commanded them, committing many insolencies,
and with a high band (like a great torrent) bearing all
down before them. All which, I say, coming to the
Emperor's ears, I am, in company with eighty thousand

regular troops, and Salem Ducullee * at our head, ordered
directly to march against them; and notwithstanding the
vast number the conjurer had with him, and those spirited
up by his pretended conjurations, yet could he not hinder
them from' flying into the heights of the mountains before
us. However, we followed them so close, that we by the
sword and musket killed vast numbers in a very little
time; and after we had at last conjured the conjurer into
our custody, we marched with him to Tedlah, where the
Emperor then was, and gladly received him at our hands,
telling him that he was very glad to see him there, and
that as he had hitherto heard so very much of his famous
conjurations, if he could tell him what death he had within
himself determined for him, he would, notwithstanding all
his past villainies, pardon him. To which the conjurer
making no answer, he told him that he thought his con-
juration to be then at an end, and that himself was become
the better conjurer of the two, for that he was very sure
his hands and feet should be cut off to the arm-wrists and
ankles ; which was immediately done, and his body thrown
on a dunghill naked, guarded by fifty soldiers till dead, and
afterwards left till it was eaten up by the dogs.
This Enseph Haunsell was actually in his days not only
a noted magician, but had therein performed many strange
and very unaccountable things in favour of Muley Hamet
Deby, as raising to all human appearance vast numbers
of armed men, and in the Emperor's palace at Mequinez
making most surprising doings, the doors in and through-
out it, when they were to all people's seeming close shut
and firmly bolted, flying open on a sudden of themselves,
and on the top of the palace walls many armed men
appearing on horseback, sometimes in grand order, riding
in ranks, and sometimes in great confusion, rallying and

charging one another sword in hand. This did I myself
see, as well as many thousand others; though indeed I
could not at that time have any further opinion of it than
that it was a trick or delusion, yet I must confess that I
had afterwards (when I was about to make my escape for
good) some reason to believe there was somewhat more
than imaginary, as shall in its proper place be set forth.
This way of putting the conjurer to death was premedi-
tated by the tyrant, though I had never before seen any
of his subjects despatched by his order that way; not but
it was (when they were up in arms one against another in
their civil wars) cruelly practised, and of which indeed I
had one night a very melancholy instance. I being out in
pursuit of some of those rebels, and straying a little from
my party, in passing by an old ruined house I heard a
most dismal groan, and which I very attentively listening
to, I soon heard to be repeated in different accents; when
stopping at the entrance, I was soon given to understand
that there were four brothers (stout young men) lying on
the floor, having all of them their hands and feet cut off,
through the cruelty of their enemies of a neighbouring
town, humbly imploring me to go to their father's house
and acquaint him with it.
And after they had given me directions, I went, found
the house, and was in a little time back again with their
father and mother, and with them sufficient help and
light; and at our entrance we found two of them dead, and
the other two almost ready to expire. However, they had
time enough to tell them by whom they were thus used;
so that I was, to my very great satisfaction, freed from all
suspicion of having any hand in it; of which, had they all
died in my absence, I might very reasonably have lain
under a very great one, and have been very innocently
punished. . And now are they all at work in removing the

two surviving unbappy wretches ; who, on their being
moved, died also, and then I was courteously entreated
by their father to go to his house; which, as thinking
myself to be altogether unsafe till I had again joined my
own party, I did not think fit to do; therefore I went
directly in quest of them.
Now am I, after conjuring the conjurer, again breath-
ing for some short time in Mequinez, and where is soon
about to be acted by the tyrant the most bloody tragedy
you ever before heard of; and though I was, during the
time of the transaction of the first part of this story, with
the caravan on the coast of Guinea, yet (as I had it from
so many undoubted reports) I shall here venture to set it
down for fact, and therefore I will tell it you from the
beginning, together with all its circumstances. The tyrant
having amongst his soldiery a particular troop of brave
men, to the number of about eight hundred, commanded
by one Musa Jerrory * (one Eli Bendoobash + being his
lieutenant), who had of a long time behaved after the
bravest manner, and, like the veteran Janissaries in the
armies of the Grand Turk, bearing down all before them ;
but talking a little too freely and openly touching the
tyrant's most unwarrantable bloody actions amongst his
subjects, which coming to his ears, he was thereat so
disturbed that he was thoroughly resolved to get rid of
them, could he tell how-and which, indeed, as standing
in very great fear of them, he could not for some time
contrive how to bring about.
However, his old friend the Devil soon put it into his
head, ordering them in a friendly manner to repair forth-
with to the river Draugh, there to receive and bring to
him to Mequinez their respective tributes, though he at
the same time very well knew there was none due to him

from them, they being, on account of their furnishing him
with a certain number of horsemen for his wars, exempted
from all other impositions whatsoever; and he knew, should
they be any further pressed, they would no doubt soon fall
on this small number and cut them to pieces. Nevertheless,
lest they might not do it so soon as he expected, he took
special care to preadvise them how they should behave to
them, viz. (for certain reasons of state, as then to him.
self only known), to put them all to the sword; for should
he at that time go about to do justice upon them at home,
it might chance, as his affairs then stood, to prove to
him of very ill consequence; therefore, as he was in
danger of his life through their means, he humbly hoped
they would rid him of them as soon as they found a fit
opportunity.
And now are these daring lions, like innocent sheep,
hurrying on to their slaughter apace, their number being
now reduced to six hundred, the rest of them being slain in
several former battles ; though on their arrival, and for
several months after, they were treated after a seeming
friendly manner, giving them every day fair promises, still
drilling them on to meet with (if they could on their side)
a careless opportunity whereby they might, with the less
danger to themselves, perform their so bloody order. But
Jerrory kept his small pumber in so good order, that they
could not even at the last find an opportunity to their
minds.
This vigilance of these few troops not a little disturbing
them, they now order, for the better execution of the
bloody tragedy, great numbers of armed men to be with
the greatest privacy raised in several places, and in the
night-time those several troops to march and join at a
certain, place in one body; and which, though they were
in all thirty thousand men, was managed with so much

secrecy, that had not Jerrory kept a good look out, they
had no doubt so surrounded him as to have performed
their orders to a tittle. But he having some sınall time
to rally his little army, put himself into as good a posture
as he could to receive them after the most advantageous
manner, his troops behaving like gallant soldiers, and in a
very short time killing thousands of the enemy.
But alas ! poor men, what could they do against so much
odds? To conquer was even impossible, and to save their
lives by flight very hazardous and uncertain ; however,
either that was to be attempted, or death must inevitably
attend them; therefore, after he had of his six hundred lost
almost two-thirds, he turned his horse and cried aloud,
“Follow me!” cutting himself a passage through the
enemy, and with two hundred and two, besides himself and
his lieutenant, in spite of all they could do, got off to
Mequinez. Which, indeed, was no more than too truly an
escape out of the frying-pan into the fire, or the sheep
running to the old wolves to tell that they would not suffer
their young ones to worry them; though had they known
the threads of their lives to be so near being cut by the
accursed treachery of a bloody tyrant, they had no doubt
sold their lives at a much dearer rate.
Immediately on their arrival into the city, even before they
could of themselves have the power to appear before the
tyrant, the two commanders were ordered before him, he
demanding of them in an angry tone if they had brought
him what he had sent them for. They told him no; for that
the Draughians, after receiving them in seeming friend-
ship, and for a long time putting them off, and drilling
them on with fair promises, had basely and treacherously
fallen upon them with thirty thousand men, and that they
only, with about two hundred more, were miraculously
escaped to tell him the most unhappy news. “News,"

said he, “ you dogs, of what?” “Why, sir,” said Jerrory,
" that they fell upon us all at once with thirty thousand
men.” “Very well,” said he, "and I don't in the least
doubt but that you, like dastardly cowards, ran away
without fighting, to the utter disgrace of me, only for the
sake of living a little longer and coming home to die by
the sword of justice; and which," said he, swearing by the
life of Mahomet, “ you shall do this same hour.” They
told him that they hoped he would first inquire better into
the merits of their actions, telling him that they had first
killed their thousands. “Your thousands,” said he, “you
dogs ! Pray why had not you stood it to the last and killed
your ten thousands ? " When drawing his sword, Bendoo.
bash cried out for mercy; at which Jerrory told him that
after so many brave actions he had seen him to perform,
he thought it beneath him and a disgrace to beg his life
of such a damnable villain ; for that he then, though too
late, saw the traitor, who, he said, had as good take his
life then as at another time; for that he would, no doubt,
at last murder all his loyal subjects, unless he was by the
true sword of justice prevented, and therefore he scorned
to beg his life on any terms of such a bloodthirsty
damnable villain. On which the tyrant at one blow struck
off his head, and that of Bendoobash at another.
Then he asked for the remainder of their men, and being
told they were all on horseback without the gate, waiting
their jommanders' orders where to set up, after giving his
guards secret instructions, he with a good body of them
went directly out to them; and after telling them, after his
deceitful manner, that he was glad to see them come home
safe again, that they had · bad of it a very troublesome
time, that their horses looked very thin, and the like, he
ordered them to alight, in order to their being sent to his
slables; when they answered him that they would, if

he pleased, ride them thither themselves. "No, no, poor
hearts," said he, "get off, that I may see how you can
stand on your own legs ;” at the same time ordering them
to deliver their arms and draw up into one rank; which
they instantly obeying, and he riding forward and backward
as if the better to view them, they were all on a sudden
and in a moment shot by his guards, saving one only, who,
seeing through the tyrant's intentions at his ordering them
to alight, rode off to one of their churches. The tyrant,
lest the victims might not be dead enough, ordered his
guards to prepare to give them a second round, which,
before they could make ready, the tyrant standing pretty
near the fallen victims, one of them being still in a
capacity of rising, and having about him a long knife, got
80 near him, that had not a lad standing by very unluckily
perceived it, he had no doubt therewith given him his
just reward by ending his days.
They were then again all shot at, and all their heads
being cut of, the bodies laid on their backs, and the head
of each man laid on his breast, they were for ten days (as
none daring to carry them off) exposed in the open street
to public view, and at last stunk to that degree that none
could endure to come near them ; but the smell even reach-
ing the tyrant's apartments, they were all at last, saving
what the dogs had eaten, carried by his order into the fields
and buried. And so ended this so horrid and barbarous
murder, which I was a witness of; though the first part, as
I said before, I being then on the coast of Guinea, is only
hearsay, which even as then sounded but harshly to his
credit, and was soon after, by the Black Army in general
- most of the late victims being their countrymen-in a
great measure revenged, by driving him out.
Immediately after the perpetration of this so horrid and
premeditated murder, I was with my comrades sent to the

castle of Boossacran,* distant from Mequinez about four
leagues; where I had, as to my own particular part, little
else to do than to hunt, fish, and fowl for myself and
comrades, having free toleration from the Emperor,
making amongst us a very good hand of it. Several
of us chiefly employed our time that way, and killing
great plenty of game, to our general satisfaction, though
not to be supposed in any way equal to that of the
Emperor. We went out, I say, but a few of us together,
without any dogs, and him with a great many, and several
hawks, as having at the least, though never a hunter, a
hundred greyhounds, or long-dogs, and on horseback and
on foot as many moors and negroes, by way of starters,
with their long poles in their hands, spreading abreast,
still beating the cover as they went on. Thus the game
sheltering therein were either on foot or on wing, it being
almost impossible for any, saying very young birds or
leverets lying very close, to escape them, having very often
on foot together four or five hares, and on wing twice as
many partridges, and dogs and hawks all at one and the
same time at work; and with the very great speed and
force the dogs ran, they being divided into as many parties
as were hares on foot, and often meeting on the turn,
struck against one another to that degree that they at
the best became useless, and many times fell quite dead
on the spot. After the Emperor spent the forenoon in
those exercises, and his stomach putting him in mind of
his dinner, he generally rode off to a pleasure-house he
had about a mile or two off, according to the part of the
country he was then in, to his dinner, though when the
maggot bit him he had it brought him into the field.
Near the walls of our castle ran a very fine river, and
plentifully stocked with many sorts of very excellent fish,

and as I for two reasons very much admired fishing, as
first for the amusement, and next the gratifying myself
and comrades with the fruits, seldom a day passed without
my taking little or more.
One day, as I and one of my comrades (a Frenchman)
were fishing, he with a casting-net and myself with a rod,
and had between us both taken a large basketful, the
Emperor with one of his brothers, before we saw them,
were on our backs, and instead of giving us any dis-
content, he in a seeming pleasing way asked if we had
taken any fish. I told him yes, showing him to the
basket; and after he had looked at them for some time,
he told us that he had not to his mind of a long time seen
finer, ordering us to carry them directly to his pleasure.
house—and which, it being from the place we were then at
no more than a mile, we did in a very little time; and just
as we were entering, the Emperor and his brother alighted
at the gate, and very unexpectedly gave us twenty gold
ducats, which cheerfully carried us back again to the river,
and we again filled our basket, and went home to our
castle as rich as emperors.
About this time the Emperor having two or three
expresses on the back of one another from Itewoossey, *
about four days' journey from Mequinez, intimating that
a great body of malecontents were there gathered,
behaving after a most insolent manner, and that they
were still increasing their numbers, he ordered all the
light horse he could pick up to be in readiness to go with
him in person to correct them, and in three days and one
night we got to the foot of the mountain wherein they had
sheltered themselves, ourselves and horses sufficiently
tired, before the rebels were apprised of our coming.
However, after some short refreshment, we marched on

foot up to their nests, though of the birds we found but
few, most of them, on notice of our coming up the
mountain, being flown. Yet, we there found some,
and some of them we took by pursuit; but their ways
being in a manner past finding out to those therewith
unacquainted, it would have been altogether as dangerous
as in vain for us to follow them any further. Therefore,
after two days' pursuit, we again returned to their nests,
stripped them of all their furniture and provision, then set
them on fire, and taking with us all their cattle returned
again down to our horses, where, after two days' refresh-
ment, and disposing of the cattle, &c., for what we could
get, we in four days followed the Emperor to Mequinez,
to which he, being mounted on the finest mare I ever
saw, rode without any attendant in the space of twelve
hours, being 140 miles from the place where we then were.
This mare was about fifteen hands in height, and she was
all over (except her eyes, which were of a fiery red, and
eyelids, which were red hairs pinked) as white as snow;
and notwithstanding the Emperor knew himself to be as
hated by his subjects as a serpent, yet did he put so much
confidence in this mare as not to fear when he was on her
back for any to come after him, for he often rode by
himself in this manner.
Now am I, after this short tour, again at Boossacran,
and every day employed in shooting, fishing, or hunting,
either for the Emperor or ourselves; and as he had
allotted us round the castle sufficient quantities of land,
with oxen, husbandry implements, and seed corn, many
of our company set themselves at work, ploughed the
ground, tilled it, and had plentiful crops. Though, as to
my own part, I being never in that way instructed, and
having others to work for me, I never troubled my head
about it, but acted by general consent as a purveyor

during the time of tillage, weeding, or harvest; and at all
intervals from our farming affairs, excepting those of
mounting the guard, we were generally all hands on the
game. And this was, I think, except my intervals at
Tamnsnah, the most agreeable of all the time of my living
in Barbary ; though during this, scarce a day passed with-
out seriously reflecting with myself on escape, which I then
found to be very hazardous. Therefore, as I found the
ruin of the country every day more apparently approaching,
and plainly foresaw that it could not be long e'er the
tyrant was driven out, and that all would be in the
utmost confusion, I for the time lived as comfortably as
I could, and with Christian patience waited the event.

ABOUT this time was the truce again broken between

The Moors having, as they thought, strongly provided
themselves with shipping, sent to sea the following four,
viz., Anjour, their Admiral, carrying twenty-four guns ;
Cassam Benisha,* a new ship never before at sea, carrying
twenty ditto, Elle Ouad, t of twenty ditto, and Absolem
Candeel, i of sixteen ditto ; and Candeel falling in with
Captain Shelley, of Plymouth, then commander of an Eng-
lish ship, though freighted by the Portuguese, he having
on board seventy Portuguese passengers, and amongst
them six friars, made prize of him, and carried him into
Mamora. Of which complaint being made to the British
Consul then at Sallee, he immediately thereon made

application to Candeel, to set them again at liberty; and
which, finding he could not do according to his hope there,
they being sent all prisoners to Mequinez, he was thither
resolved to follow them, in order to make his complaint
to the Emperor. And thither indeed he went, taking with
one Solomon Namias, a Jew, as his interpreter, and was
soon introduced to the tyrant, who asked him what he
would have. To which he answered by the Jew, that he
was come to acquaint his Excellency with the breach of
the truce which had so lately been punctually concluded
on both sides between his subjects and them of his royal
master; who, he said, intended nothing less than giving
him or any of them the least uneasiness, by way of any
hostilities, as Candeel had very lately done on him and his ;
therefore he humbly hoped that his Highness would be
pleased to order the ship and prisoners to be again restored.
To which the tyrant told him, that the prisoners were
subjects to the King of Portugal, his bitter enemy, and not
to the King of Great Britain, his master, and therefore
lawful prize. When the Jew told him that he thought it
very hard that the English should not be allowed to carry
in their own ships passengers of any nation in peace with
them; however, he humbly hoped that if he was not then
disposed to set the Portuguese at liberty, he would at least
set at liberty all the English and their ship.
But Candeel being present, he asked the tyrant if he knew
with whom he had been so long talking. "Talking with,"
said he, “with an Englishman.” “No, sir," said Candeel,
"but with a Jew.” “Indeed !” said he," with a Jew!” and
calling aloud to his guards, “ Here," said he,“ take away
Mr. Jew and burn him directly;" and then the soldiers
laying hold on him, he cried out to the Emperor to save
his life, and he would give him two hundred cantles of
silver ; nay, that he would give it only to be admitted to

speak a few words. "No, thou dog," said the tyrant, "all
the silver in Barbary shall not excuse thee; therefore,
I say, take him away and burn him ; ” which they
instantly did, laying him flat on his belly, heaping in a
most cruel manner the wood upon him alive, and in a
little time he, with grievous shrieks, and no doubt in
very great agonies, expired. His house was afterwards
ransacked of an immense sum of money, and other riches.
On which the consul, seeing no likelihood of better success,
departed, as I was informed, for England. However, I
know he was back again in a little time, and met with
better success, as you shall by and by hear.
Not long after Shelley's captivity, the piratical villains
being all hands at sea in taking and making prize of all
Christian nations, there were brought to Mequinez the
men which belonged to four other English ships; and I
having information of their coming, and liberty when I
pleased to go to the city, I set out from my castle very
early in the morning to see if any of them belonged to or
near Falmouth; and a little before sunrising, I within
a league of the city met with a great many of the foremost
of them. Inquiring of them what parts of England they
were of, and if any one of them belonged to or near the
above-said place, they told me yes, there was one coming up,
named George Davies, of Flushing, a small seaport town
within that harbour ; and with whom I soon joined, asking
him if he knew me. He told me no. “Why," said I, “ you
and I were once schoolfellows together at the church-town
of Milor.” “Indeed!” said he, “I cannot imagine who you
should be, unless you are Thomas Pellow, who I have of a
long time heard was in his childhood carried with his
uncle into Barbary.” “Indeed," said I, “I am that un-
happy person,” telling him I was very glad to see him
again, though very sorry it should be in that part of the

world, under such unhappy circumstances. He told me
it was his bard fate, but he must endeavour, as well as I
had done before him, to bear it with patience.
And after they were all entered the city, and according to
custom carried before the Emperor, and sent to the Canute,
I went to him, and cheered him up in the best manner I
could, and afterwards visited him as often as opportunity
would permit, he being with the rest of his comrades put
to hard labour, and so kept for the space of three or four
months; when the consul returned from England again with
the character of ambassador, and full power to treat with the
tyrant for the redemption of all the English slaves ; which,
notwithstanding his so late ill success, and no doubt no
little fright at the barbarous usage of the Jew, he managed
80 well, that he procure their freedom in a very little time,
being in all 148 in number; and they were by him and
old Hammet Benelly * conducted to Tetuan, there to be
kept till better security should be given for their ransoms,
though they were at last, on the ambassador's offering
himself to remain there for them as an hostage till it
arrived, all by the Bashaw's consent shipped off.
And happy indeed was it for them, for they had but a
short time departed before the tyrant was driven out by the
Black Army, and Muley Aly set up in his room, and a
peremptory order sent by him to Tetuan to send them all
back again to Mequinez. These released slaves, on their
marching off from Mequinez, had leave (for the better
performance of their march to Tetuan) to refresh them.
selves for eight days at Cassavah-bartan, t where, at their
request, I undertook to carry them some brandy, and got
thither for the first time in safety with several gallons in
bullocks' bladders : and they desiring me to come again
the next day with some more, I told them it was a very

dangerous undertaking. However, to oblige them, I would
try what I could do, and had accordingly got my bladders
again filled and tied up round my waist within my
blanket. But alas ! in going without the city, I was very
unhappily surprised by some of the Emperor's people ;
who, on their finding the bladders about me, laid hold on
me and committed me to close prison in irons; though
not altogether, I believe, so much on account of the
brandy, as of a jealousy they had (as I was so great with
my countrymen) of my endeavouring an escape with them.
So that in all likelihood (unless they were by some Jews
going to Hartan, who knew how it was with me, informed
to the contrary) my countrymen, no doubt, thought that I
did not use them kindly; but whether it was one or the
other, I know that I suffered by it very severely, insomuch
that had not Muley Abdallah, through his so frequent ill
usage of his subjects, been every moment in danger and
fear of being driven out, I should in all likelihood have
there taken up my quarters for a much longer time; but I
was, at the end of twelve days, again set at liberty.
Now might you hear, even in all places, the Blacks
threatening, “A new master, a new master, or none !"
being the general cry; which, and on certain advices of a
great body of them gathered at Shoarumlah, about two
days' march from Mequinez, and that they were soon about
to pay him a visit, put him into such a fright, that he, by
way of sugar-plum, sent them 220,000 ducats of silver ;
and whilst they were disputing about their respective
dividends, he packed up all the rest of his treasure and
fled with twelve thousand horse; but be was in a short
time to that degree forsaken by them, that before he
reached Morocco he had not more than five hundred of
them remaining. Yet, notwithstanding their daily falling
off from him, he still took special care to destroy all the

stores of corn as he went on, so as the Blacks might not
be the better for it; and which, as they followed him,
they too soon found, to their very great dissatisfaction.
However, they still hurried on the pursuit, till they came
up within two days' march of him; of which being ac-
quainted by his spies (after being at Morocco ten days), he
with his small number hurried thence four days' long
journey by a round-about way towards Sallee, and settled
at a place called Bolowan, where he had also vast stores
of grain laid up, all which he freely gave to the inhabitants,
with liberty to carry off at their discretion anywhere
but to the enemy. And here, as I could not yet venture
on escape, and foreseeing the scale would soon again turn
to his side, notwithstanding his cruel and bloody nature,
I, only by myself, joined him ; and which proved, indeed,
according to my own sentiments, of two evils to be choosing
the best.
The second day after my joining him, on notice from his
spies that the Black Army were again within two days'
march of him, he with his small number (which was
then reduced to four hundred horse, excluding his beasts
of carriage) moved thence three days' smart journey to
Shishrah; where, on certain notice of the Blacks not
following him, we settled sixteen days, and at the end of
which, on hearing they were again within two days' march
of us, he moved also thence, and in three days' and one
night's tedious journey we got to the mountain of Iminta-
noot; and there falling all that night a very heavy snow,
we were by the morning almost dead with cold. However,
we were soon after daybreak, by way of warming our
blood, attacked by a great body of mountaineers, who
killed several of our small number, and of the mules laden
with Muley Abdallah's treasure they took and carried off
at least forty. All which, notwithstanding our few could

have beat them, did we (as fearing a far greater danger
to be at our heels) think ourselves obliged to suffer, and
to hurry on till we thought ourselves to be better secured
from their rage. And that evening we got to Immintackca-
most, between two huge mountains, ourselves and cattle
almost spent, where we rested till midnight, and afterwards
travelled on between the mountains till daybreak, and till
four o'clock that afternoon; at which time we got to
Umcest Elcashib,* at the foot of another very high moun-
tain, called Bebown,t settling there that night, and the
next day over this high mountain to Terrident, where he
was most kindly received by the inhabitants, and directly by
them put in possession of a strong castle ; where the Black
Army, as thinking their families at home to be greatly
exposed in their absence amidst such distracting commo-
tions, did not think proper to follow him.
Now is the tyrant again breathing in security, remaining
here about eighteen months, though not altogether in
peace ; for, notwithstanding all our neighbouring districts
(saving that only that of Howorrah) on his summons came
in to his assistance, yet they being a pack of daring
thieves, living all together on the spoil of their neighbours,
would not on any terms obey him, but plainly told his
messengers, that whereas they had so long depended on
their own strength, they were then so resolved to continue,
and not to submit themselves to him, or anybody else, be
the consequence what it would, and that they cared not
for him a rush.
Now is the tyrant, notwithstanding his haughty and
cruel nature, at a stand how to behave, such affronts being
never before put upon him. However, as his affairs now

stood, he thought himself obliged to temporise and win
them to his party, if he could, they being about six thou-
sand daring fellows; and his own army being so very
small, he knew if he could by fair persuasions get them
over to him, it would be, as his desperate fortune then
stood, of very great advantage to him ; and therefore he
sent to them again, though he was answered to the same
purpose, gaining nothing but a more fancy confirmation of
their insolence, which nettled him to that degree, that he
was resolved to watch all opportunities to be up with them.
He being also solicited by the honest party (to whom these
thieves had of a long time been a grievous nuisance) to
correct them, he went out against them with two thousand
horse and four thousand foot, marching directly to Umce-
derrah, a little walled town, where many of their chiefs
resided, and where there was then about six hundred of
them; who shutting the gates against us, in an insolent
manner bid us defiance.
The main body of them was then abroad on the plunder.
And now, on my seeing many of our people to have raised
themselves on the top of the wall, and not being willing
to be behind any of them, I was soon wounded by two
musket shots in my left shoulder and the small of my
left leg, and by some of my comrades holpen off the
wall, many others of them soon sharing the same fate,
and were with me carried off to our camp. There we
were by far in the better situation, for as they were
carrying us thither, we saw the main body of the rebels
coming back to the relief of their town and comrades ;
and our main body being between the town and them,
there was soon betwixt them a smart engagement, our
people receiving their first fire, and then instantly falling
on them sword in hand; which way of fighting they not at
all liking, like dastardly villains turned their backs and

fled. However, their flight was not so prosperous, but that
we slackened the pace of a great many of them, killing at
least two thousand; and our party, saving about a thou-
sand, who were sent to plunder and burn the town, returned
with fifteen hundred of their heads to Terrident, to the
very great joy of the inhabitants, and with the loss only
on our side of about one hundred and fifty men, and about
sixty wounded.
Now is the tyrant, after subduing those insolent thieves,
in very high esteem at Terrident, and treated by the
country round as their Emperor indeed, heaping in their
presents upon him in great abundance; and those who
were not thereof so mindful as he thought they ought to
be, he failed not to quicken their memories by a party of
horse ; though, in short, he had no very great occasion of
using hostilities, all (or at least the much greater part of
them) readily conforming to his demands, and his army,
very much to his satisfaction, by the end of eighteen
months was increased to eight thousand brave soldiers.
At which time, on advice from his mother of the Blacks
being also highly disgusted with the proceedings of Muley
Ali, and that she had again gained the greatest part of
them to his interest and restoration to the throne, and that
she would have him to basten with all diligence to Mequinez,
he with his army left Terrident, and in twenty four days
arrived at and sat down before Tedlah, where the Alcaydes
Mulootjibbilly and Mahomet Belchouse were with four
thousand soldiers closely shut up, and denied him entrance
after a most insolent manner, which to that degree nettled
him, that he was thoroughly resolved to get in by force, or
not to give out so long as he saw any probability remain-
ing. And there was for three days very hot work on both
sides, when the rebels finding they could not with all their
strength keep him from entering, they gave us up the town

in possession, and retired into the castle, where they held
us at bay for the space of thirty-three days, and then,
though they had not all this while killed of us above a
hundred, they surrendered themselves to the Emperor's
mercy.
Now are they ordered to march out, and thirty-seven of
their chiefs (but without Mulootjibbilly) instantly appearing,
they were by the Emperor (who was then sitting on horse-
back on the other side of a river which ran between him
and the town, out of musket shot) commanded before him,
asking them in a furious manner if they did not think
themselves to be very insolent fellows, not only to deny
their sovereign entrance into his own town, but impudently
to murder his body-guards before his face, as no doubt they
would him had it been in their power; that he thought they
might think it enough for him to be driven from his own,
and to make such hard shift as he had done for the last
two years, to content them for all the injuries he had ever
done them, for that he had undergone a very hard and
unjust exile. Yet had fortune again put it in his power to
revenge his own injuries, and that they should be the first
sacrifices to his just rage.
Then looking at them very fiercely, he commanded of
them aloud where was Jibilly. They told him, that as he
had been for some time before in his dishabille, he was
then, in order to appear with the greater decency before
his sovereign, putting on his clothes. “A dog," said
be, “bas be a mind to die in state!” looking at our
people. “Go,” said he, “bring the dog before me!"
but hearing soon after, as all thought, the report of a
musket, a messenger came to tell him that he had shot
himself with a pistol. “A dastardly dog," said he, “shot
himself! Go run, fly, bear his body to the top of the walls,
throw it down, and drag it hither;" which was instantly

done, and his head as their grand ringleader cut off, and
after his, those of all the rest, and their bodies thrown into
the river ; when he also ordered to be brought before him
all Jibilly's servants, in number thirty-seven, who were all
used after the same manner; and all the heads were set
up on a little watch-tower, just within the drawbridge ;
after which he pardoned all the rest, and then we were
again at liberty to refresh ourselves.
However, as our army was by this time very much
increased from Mequinez and divers other places, he did
not think fit to go into the town, but encamped with
them on the further side of the river, where he had
before received the victims; and where in a very short
time after, came to him Howmead Losmee,* and with
him six thousand Blacks, to acquaint him from the Black
Army in general, that they were all again entirely in
his interest, and that he was come by their orders to
reconduct him to his former possessions. To which he
answered, that as he had so lately received at their hands
such ill usage, it was very much to be doubted if their
hearts and tongues wagged together, for that he had
through their means already undergone most unspeakable
hardships, therefore he hoped they could not take it ill
(considering it to be very natural for a burnt child to dread
the fire) for him to insist on nine of their principals to be
first delivered into his hands, as a pledge of their sincerity,
and after naming who they should be, as first Selam Ducul-

again returned with them, when he, notwithstanding his
slippery footing, ordered four of them, viz., the two elder
Ducullees, Adberheem, and Coddoorlasseree to be instantly
on the spot beheaded ; and the four sons after beholding
the deaths of their fathers, to be with Bememsoddeel con-
ducted by the army to Mequinez, where the tyrant at the
head of his old army and the so scarcely reconciled blacks
intermixed, got safe in six easy days' march; and, after his
long absence of twenty-two months, again in possession of
the empire; though by the blacks, nor they by him, no
further trusted, than one enemy might another.
Now is Muley Abdallah, notwithstanding his so late and
grievous exile, again about Mequinez, beginning again to
butcher his subjects,* sending the five surviving hostages
in chains to Boossacran, where the four brothers were in a
very short time strangled, and Bememsoddel (to show the
tyrant's very extraordinary clemency) pardoned, and sent
back again to Mequinez to rejoice with his friends. The
tyrant, not content with murdering his subjects, treated
the poor Christians at Boossacran after a most grievous
and cruel manner, setting them at work in digging a deep
and wide ditch through a hard rock round his pleasure-
house, himself with his severe eye being their overseer.
One day came thither, with their presents and excuses for
not waiting on him at Tedlah, twenty-five of the principal
inhabitants of old Fez, telling him in great humility, that
notwithstanding they had not waited on him there, yet
were they nevertheless his Majesty's most dutiful and
obedient servants altogether as much as those that bad,
and that he might be assured that it should in all their
future actions be made most evidently appear. At which
the tyrant, smiling, answered, “My most rebellious Fasees,
I mean my masters and governors, or at least I know it

would be were it in your power, which I am resolved shall
never be."
Then calling to his guards, “Here, take these dogs
and call the headsman," who instantly appearing, he
ordered him to cut off all their heads; and the victims
being placed in a row, he struck off twenty-four of them,
at as many strokes, and then the tyrant ordered him to
hold his hand, for that he had taken notice of the survivor
to be blind in one eye, and therefore as he could then see
more than all the rest, he would send him back to his
fellow-citizens to reform their errors, and to tell them if
they did not he would not in a very short time leave a
head upon the shoulders of any one of them. Although in
that, indeed, he was very much mistaken, he being himself
in a very little time after, by the Black Army and then of
Fez, through the instigation of this narrow-escaped blink-
ard, a second time driven out, and Mahomet Woolderriva
(one of his brothers) * set up in his room. And now the
tyrant wanting money, horses, arms, &c., I am, with
Bashaw Cossam Bereezom f and several thousand others,
sent to Belearge's old garrison of Stant (or rather, indeed,
my own), I being after his death put in possession of it
by old Muley Smine. Then the inhabitants were directly
ordered to bring in all they had, and which I believe many
of them did, and others were about to do, as they would
no doubt all done, had not the tyrant fled with a few into
the mountains, sending a letter to the Bashaw at Stant
for him to follow him with all his people, for that on him
was his sole dependence, and therefore as his affairs were
then at the lowest ebb, he desired that he would be as expe-
ditious in it as possible he could ; yet notwithstanding be
was very inclinable thereto, and used all possible arguments
with his people, he could not prevail with more (though

our whole army then was in all 15,000) than 800 to go
with him. And as to my own part, I thought I had followed
him and his evil genius too far before, and therefore as I
saw a likely prospect for escape, was resolved to follow him
no further, but with all my might to pursue it; and in
order thereto I directly went back in company of 14,000
of my fellow-soldiers to Mequinez, and went directly to the
Black Army, where we found Mahomet Woolderriva as
Emperor at their head, offering him our service, and directly
joining them, and as at that time our number, by way of
falling from one party and joining the other, was very con-
siderable, we were by him most courteously received.
Now before I can bring my marks to bear, I find myself
obliged to make a short tour or two, and after my so long
and many good services in the armies of the tyrant, am
now about to fight against him, as indeed I could always
(and especially after his cruel usage of my deliverer from
the bloody knife at Assamoor) have found in my heart to
have done; for notwithstanding I followed him and his evil
genius so long, yet did I always hate him, and now to that
degree, that I was resolved to hazard the last drop of my
own blood to sacrifice that of the tyrant to Simmo Hamet's
ghost. And in order thereunto I am now one in an army of
100,000 well-appointed soldiers following him with a zealous
resolution of revenge into the mountains, and though we
made all imaginable speed and searched the lurking-places
as hunters for their game for the continuance of three
days, yet could not we light on him; therefore as the
weather was excessive cold, the snow prodigious deep, and
still more falling, we by the general consent for that time,
and till a more convenient season, left him there with his
few attendants to cool his 'ungovernable passions, and
returned almost dead with cold to Mequinez.*

Now am I again all on fire for escape, and notwithstand-
ing my former miscarriages and miraculous preservations
that way, why might not I once be so lucky to get clear ?
I was twice before within an ace of it; and therefore, why
might not my chance the third time turn up that ace also ?
However, I thought it highly necessary, that before an
affair of that nature was again to be undertaken, it ought
to be with myself seriously debated, and therefore I seriously
considered thereof, and proposed several ways to myself.
As first, that notwithstanding my so narrow escape, on
failure of escaping at Marcegongue, why might not I now
be by that way successful ? To which I was by myself soon
answered, Remember the murdering knife at Assamoore
bow narrowly I missed it, and that my deliverer was then
dead, and very probably many of my cruel persecutors
still living ; why might I not fall again into their hands ?”
And therefore it was a most hazardous and dangerous
undertaking. “Then," said I, “why may not I get off
from Sallee?” I was again by myself answered, " Con-
sider the story of the sloop, and Alcayde Ambork Foolan,
the Black Governor.” “That,” said I, “ can be no obstacle
to my designs, he being to my knowledge long since dead;
and as to the Moors, they knew nothing of the matter;"
and therefore set it down in probability number one.
And next came in question, that in case I could not suc-
ceed there to my mind, what likelihood might there be by way
of Santa Cruz? To which I was again by myself answered,
that Santa Cruz was a very long and dangerous journey;
however, if I took care to manage with caution, it might
be the most likely of the two. So I for the time, without
settling my resolutions, left it to bang between them both
till the morning, and so well as I could settled myself for
the night to sleep, and I being therein very much disturbed
by dreams, as how I should get up and be going, &c. I

at my awaking made a thorough resolution with myself to
go first to Sallee, and if I could not there perform to my
mind, to proceed for the latter place.
My resolutions thus settled, I made all the necessary
preparations in my power for my departure ; and then,
to my very great dissatisfaction. I was, on some advices
brought to Mequinez from the mountain Ceedehamsoe,
directly again summoned to arms, and with the army
(consisting of one hundred thousand Blacks and fifty
thousand Moors) obliged to march thither; for that Muley
Abdallah was there, and that he had there about him
a vast army of the mountaineers, which indeed we soon
found far to exceed our numbers. But the weather
being exceeding wet, as we had almost continual rains for
sixteen days, we could not, so soon as we would, attack
them; however, at last the rains ceasing, we fell upon them
sword in hand, and after a shrewd skirmish, wherein many
thousands were slain on both sides, we put them to flight,
the tyrant (soon after the commencement of the engage-
ment) with a few showing the rest the way. And as they
were well acquainted with those secret haunts, and we on
the other hand altogether unacquainted, we thought it by
no means proper to follow them, but returned again to
Mequinez; and though we had of it for two months a very
hard time, and lost a great many thousands of our men,
yet I am, thank God, as to my own part, to my very great
satisfaction unwounded, and which did (thank the Divine
Majesty) in a wonderful manner confirm my former resolu-
tions; and on the eighth day following I set out. But
before I proceed, I shall first beg leave to acquaint you,
that on the seventh day, or day before my departure, I
happening to be in company with two of my old acquaint-
ance, a German and a Spaniard, there came in a black
woman, who looked very hard at me, desiring I would give

her a blankeel. “A blankeel!” said I. “Yes," said she,
"and then I will tell you all the secrets of your heart."
I told her I would with all my heart give her a blankeel ;
but as to my fortune, as being no doubt but a foolish whim,
I had much rather it should be left alone, and therefore she
should not trouble her head any further about it. “Foh,"
said she ; " but I must, that you may (when you are got
off safe to your own country) think upon me.” “To my
own country!” said I, in a seeming surprise. “What in
God's name can you mean by that? Prithee talk no more
of such impossibilities.” “Oh, no, no,” said she ; "it is
not impossible, and that you will soon find."
Then putting one end of a piece of green cane she
had in her right hand into the fire, taking it out, and
therewith crossing the palm of her left hand, she told
me my real fortune indeed ; as how I had of a long
time, and was then resolved within myself on escape,
that I had more than once before endeavoured it, though
without success, even to the hazard of my life. How-
ever, I should not then fear, for I should actually be
successful. “ Therefore," said she, “ let not your courage
be cast down, for you shall, though with much toil
and many hazards, get safe home, and find your
father and mother (who have for many years suffered a
great deal on your account) still living.” “Oh,” said I,
“you are in that very much mistaken, my father and
mother having for many years ago been in their graves ;
and had they, as you say, been still living, they would
never have been by me seen more. Therefore,” said I,
“ pray talk no further on this subject, for if it should be
carried any further, it might be taken for fact, and prove
to me of very dangerous consequence.” “No, no," said
she, " keep but a good heart and your own secrets, and all
the devils in Barbary shall not have power to frustrate your

intentions, for to Christian land are you bound, and thither
again are you destined to go."
To lean on, or to give any credit to such fopperies as
these, was what I could never before chime in with; yet,
as she had so far told me my intentions hitherto, I could
pot but entertain of what was to come more than a common
notion, and that Enseph Haunsel's magic doings heretofore
at Mequinez were more than imaginary; and therefore I
was very much encouraged herewith. And now am I about
to lay me down for the last time to sleep in Mequinez,
where I had so often before had an aching heart; and as I
could not now take any rest, I seriously reflected with
myself how wonderfully I had been hitherto (through the
goodness of God) preserved from so many perils and
dangers, how many thousands I had seen slain in the
field of battle, and why it might not have been my
unhappy fate as well as theirs ; then humbly offering up
my most unfeigned thanks to God for all His mercies
hitherto received, and earnestly imploring His future
protection, got me up, and soon with an eager resolution
set myself in order for my march. And as all my trans-
actione under any of their emperors end here, I shall (and
I think very properly) call the following part of my history
my wonderful escape and happy return.

bent on escape. In which, as all was then in the utmost
confusion, and I was so very well acquainted with the

success; though you will find my travels to be attended
with many grievous troubles and hazardous incidents; and
which, could I have foreseen, would no doubt in a great
measure have frustrated my designs. However, as these
afflictions happened to me unlooked for, I no doubt bore
them with a braver and more steadfast resolution.

and painful undertaking; and at the end of the eighth day,

the second time into the mountains, I set out thence about
midnight with myself only for Sallee. There in three
days, and the latter part of that night, I safely arrived,
and notwithstanding I made all diligent inquiry after a
ship, yet could I not there to my mind find any for my
purpose in three days, and therefore I was resolved to push
my way for Santa Cruz so well as I could ; and the next day,
at my going out of the town, I was surprised by some
soldiers, who laid hold on me, and carried me before Muley
Mataddy,* the Governor, and brother to the then Emperor,
who asked them who I was, and for what reason brought
before him. To which he was answered that they could
not tell. “No!” said he ; "are you not then very pretty
fellows to stop a man for you not what?" asking me who
I was, and whither I was going. I told him I was one of
his brother's soldiers, and that as I very lately returned
to Mequinez from following Muley Abdallah a second time
into the mountains, and correcting the mountaineers
gathered there in his favour, I was by his brother's
permission come thither to visit my old acquaintance, and
that I was then again going back to Mequinez; on which
he gave the soldiers orders to set me at liberty. Yet did
they thus treat me a second and a third time, at my going
out of the town, still carrying me before him, telling him
at last that I was a Christian, and that I was about to
make my escape to Christian Land. “To Christian
Land !” said he, staring me in the face. “Sir," said I,
" as to that they may say as they please; however, before
your Excellency gives any credit to it, I humbly desire you
will ask them their reasons for suspecting me; " and they
being able to give none, he told them that they were a pack
of insolent fellows, that they should let me go, and if to
Christian Land, what was that to them ?

Now am I again at liberty, and, as a blind, again on my
road towards Mequinez, but out of which I soon turned
towards Tedlah, wherein I had not travelled very far
before I fell in company with one of their noted conjurers,
having with him about four hundred of the poor credulous
inhabitants, going also that way. But his conjurations
did not find out my intentions, as to whither I was
travelling, no more than that himself and followers should
be that evening by a greater party plundered and stripped,
as indeed they were, together with myself, to our skins ;
which, though a grievous misfortune, I was with Christian
patience obliged to bear, and to travel on in this condition
full three days in very cold weather, before I could get any
thing even to cover my nakedness, and then I was so happy
to get, through very great chance, a piece of old matting ;
and afterwards in that condition suffering extreme cold and
hunger, it was eight days before I reached Tedlah, though
there I did not enter, but directly crossed the river running
at the foot of the high mountain Summough, and where I
most opportunely met two Spaniards straggling the country,
by way of deceiving the credulous inhabitants with their
quack medicines.
However, be that as it will, it was for them good
enough, and the same Spaniards were to me very kind
and true friends in necessity, giving me a piece of an
old blanket, filling my belly with such as they had,
giving me friendly advice, six blankeels, several of their
medicines, and an old lancet and burning iron, to set up
for myself; and which indeed I, the better to conceal my
intentions in my travels through the country, directly put
in practice. And now am I asking every one I meet, if
they had any work for the doctor; and the day after my
Parting from my benefactors, I happened to see a woman
standing at the entrance of a tent, of whom (after giving

her the country salute) I asked if she had any occasion or
business for the doctor. “Yes," said she, “I have, and
more I doubt than you are able to perform," calling to her
daughter to help her father forth to the light; and which,
whilst the girl was about, the good wife asked me what I
did with those things in my hand; and where, indeed, as
I had no pocket, I was obliged to carry them. “Do with
them?” said I, looking her full in the face; "the one is for
letting blood, and the other used in many distempers for
burning, they being in my way of business two of the most
necessary instruments.” “Oh, then," said she, “I suppose
you are an experienced doctor ?" "Yes," said I, " instead
of a better.” “Alas !” said she, “I wish with all my
heart you may cure my husband, for he is so very drowsy,
that I fear he will die in his sleep." By this time his
daughter bad brought him forth to the door of the tent.
“Now, doctor," said the wife, “is he not a sad object ?"
“Indeed," said I, “he is, and I could wish with all my
heart I had for all our sakes seen him sooner, for that his
distemper was then gone very far, and his condition very
dangerous ; however, I would try what I could do on him,
there being but two ways of saving his life, and if one of
them (which was bleeding) would not do, I must be also
obliged to practice the other, which was burning."
So I went directly to work in binding up his arm, and to
that degree tied it with a strong hempen cord, that he com-
plained of it very much. And now I am at a stand and a
very great loss (had the instrument been never so well in
order) how to perform, and in the condition it then was,
much more so, for it was really very blunt, and extremely
rusty; however, as I found myself obliged to make the best
use I could of a bad market, I in or near the vein gave him
a very hearty prick, asking him if he felt it. “Feel it !"
said he, "yes, yes.” “Well," said I, “best of all.” And

little or no blood appearing, I twice repeated it, and though
I pricked him much deeper than at first, yet could not I
for my life (though I made him twist like an eel) make him
bleed; and then I told him that I feared I should also be
obliged to burn him. “Burn me!” said he in a very great
surprise. “Yes," said I, “burn you.” “No, I hope not,”
said he. “Oh, but,” said I, "I do not mean by putting
you into the fire, but with a pretty little iron I have for
that purpose, in the head.” “And do you think, doctor,
that will do me any good ?" "That,” said I, “I cannot tell;
but if you will be conformable to my rules, either that will
do you good, or nothing." "Oh, then, good doctor, burn
me, burn me;" and which, indeed, after heating my iron
red-hot, I did in three several places very smartly, till I
made him (as well he might) to twist and cry out after a
most piteous manner. “Well,” said I, "you are, I think,
considering your so very dangerous condition, a very faint-
hearted soldier," desiring him to look, if he could, at my
forehead, and to tell me if he did not think it to be much
more burnt than I had burnt him. “Yes," said he," and
it was, no doubt, very painful to you.” “Yes," said I,
" that it was, and yet my doctor did not think so, nor that
he had burnt me enough. But come,” said I, “have a good
heart, take this small paper of powders about ten o'clock
at night, and if you cannot sleep, it will be as I desire.
For as your distemper is what we call a lethargy, sleep will
incessantly steal on you; and therefore, when you find
yourself pretty much inclined to it, and your wounds are
not painful enough to keep you waking, order the good
woman to rub them up afresh with her fingers, and never
mind the pain ; " telling him further, that as I was obliged
to go that night to a patient about a league off, I could for
that time stay with him no longer, and that by the time I
came back, I did not doubt but to hear of his being much

easier." And after I had filled my belly with cuscassoo,
and for my doctorship received six blankeels, as an earnest
penny, and a cake of white bread, I left them to their
prophet Mahomet, and their country doctors; and though
I had the good fortune to go no more back to inquire into
the success of the operations, yet had I an account of it by
one of his sons soon after, to my very great surprise, as
you will by and by hear.
Now am I again on the tramp; and that evening, instead
of one league, I travelled five, ascending up to the top of
a high mount called Itatteb, where I found several in-
habited tents, but no admittance. However, I with much
ado got out of one of them a pretty large billet of fire;
and with which, after I had gathered good store of dry
wood, and laid a good parcel of it in a heap, I kindled a
fire, and before the darkness came on I had gathered wood
enough, as I thought, to continue my fire all night; which
no sooner approached, than I plainly heard a great many
jackals coming yelping towards me, and still drawing
nearer and nearer, which gave me sufficient reason to
suppose I should be soon surrounded by far more dangerous
companions, as indeed I soon was by lions, tigers, leopards,
panthers, &c., in abundance, making such a hideous and
frightful noise as was enough to terrify a more courageous
man than myself.
Though I cannot say I was altogether void of fear,
yet was I thoroughly persuaded with myself that, so
long as my fire continued, they would not offer to approach
me so near as to do me any harm, I almost continually
holding a firebrand well-lighted at one end in my hand,
twirling it round my head, and sometimes throwing
it amongst them; and, at the approach of daylight, they,
without taking their leave, like unmannerly guests left me,
though I must confess I was much better pleased with

their absence than with their company. I then began to
set forward on my journey; and though I was very hungry,
and had most of my cake still remaining, yet would not I
venture to break my fast till I was got clear out of this
mountain. And well was it for me, in all likelihood, that I
did not, for in a very short time, as I, instead of eating,
was with a watchful eye looking sharp round me, I saw a
large tiger lying on his belly, with his legs under him in a
proper posture for leaping, within twenty feet of the little
path I was walking in; when I, instantly taking my eyes
off him, passed nimbly by, so that I received from him no
further hurt than the fright; and in less than half an
hour after, I got up within thirty yards of the largest lion
I had ever seen before, sitting on his breech just in my
road—though this did not, I declare, in comparison with
the tiger, at all terrify me, walking up towards him with
a fierce look, hollowing at him, and threatening him all I
could ; at which he got him upon his legs, severely lashing
his loins with his tail, and roaring after a most terrible
manner, went out of my sight in a very little time, though
I again met him a second and a third time, and then he,
after like usage, left me entirely. And in an hour after I
got to the foot of the mountain on the other side, where
lived Alcayde Woldlattabbee,* one of Muley Abdallah's
old soldiers, and my very particular friend, whither I went,
and was by him most kindly received ; and on his asking
me what business had called me that way, I told him that
I was in pursuit of our distressed master; and which, as
the Blacks had most severely used me on his account, I
could do no sooner ; therefore I hoped that it was not then
too late for me to be by him instructed how to proceed
further. “That,” said he, “I cannot very well tell, yet
did I very lately hear a rumour as if he should be gone to
* Al Kaïd Oold-et-Tabee.

Santa Cruz.” “That,” said I, “I heard, and thither was
resolved to follow, but first to call on you in my way, in
order to its further confirmation.” “Well, my old friend,"
said be," but what need have you to be in so much hurry?
Stay with me first three or four days to refresh yourself,
during which we may chance to hear further of him."
And this offer, indeed, I was very glad of, as well as that
my story was so well taken. And on his asking me by
what way I got thither, I told him, together with all the
difficulties, hardships, and transactions I had gone through,
as how I was plundered and stripped, how I was obliged to
practice by way of doctor, how I had met with a sick, or
rather indeed a dead man, for that all the doctors in the
world could not cure him ; however, with what I did for
him he was so well pleased, that he ordered his wife to
give me six blankeels, my bellyful of cuscassoe, and a
cake of white bread to carry with me; how I had been all
that night surrounded by wild beasts, and how I had met
with in the morning a tiger and a lion, and what means I
had made use of to escape them.
Then I consented to stay with him for two or
three days. And the third day, a little before my
departure, who should, to my very great surprise, hap-
pen to come there to tell the Alcayde that his father
was dead, but one of my old lethargic patient's sons ?
“Dead !" said the Alcayde. “Pray of what distemper?"
“ That, sir," said he, “I cannot tell, though one of the
straggling doctors told him when I was from home that
it was a letchery; and notwithstanding he had six
blankeels, his bellyful of cuscassoe, and a huge great
cake of white bread to carry with him for his pains,
yet did he letcher him out of his life.” “Poor man!"
said the Alcayde, “then our old friend is actually dead at
last !” “Yes, eir," said he, "he is, for my brothers and

241
I threw him into his grave.” “Well, my friend," said the
Alcayde, " that was the last good office you could do him,
and as he was so long languishing under such torments, it
was by far the best place for him.” “As to that,” said
the young man, “ we cannot tell : not that I believe he
could by course of nature have lived much longer, yet no
doubt the doctor hastened his end, for he cut him and
burnt him to that degree, that he never enjoyed one
moment's ease after the operation ; and could I light on
him, I would soon spoil his doctorship.”
All this did I with my ears hear, and with my eyes
often saw the Alcayde tipping me the wink, insomuch
that I could not be easy any longer there ; but soon
after finding an opportunity to take my leave, I took
my way thence for the river Tennet;* and as I travelled
all night, I got the next morning to the foot. of the
mountain Dimminet,f a very plentiful part of the
country, the mountains round being in the seasonable
times of the year plentifully stored with many sorts of
delicious fruits, and especially grapes in abundance,
yielding great store of very excellent wine. It was, before
I could get free of these parts, full sixteen days ; during
which I sold a great many of my medicines, such as small
papers of bitter apples powdered, of which were in these
woods great plenty, and are a prodigious purgative; white
dog's date, ellebore, and red pepper mixed, by way of
clearing the brain and eyes, and which made them to weep
and sneeze gallantly; and with my pretty little iron I
burnt a good number, one of them in particular in the
belly for a dropsy; and, to the very great content of
himself and wife, I took thereout a very large quantity of
yellow water, and received for it a gold ducat. On which I,
with a Spaniard I had there procured to go with me, hurried

thence twelve leagues to the river of Tessout, still further
on towards Morocco; and as we travelled all that night,
we got the next evening to the riverside in good season, so
as we had time enough before night to catch a dish of fish
for our suppers.
But alas ! how could we catch any without tackle ?
We had neither hook nor line. However, we were through
great chance and a good deal of trouble soon furnished
with the latter through means of some hairs we got
from a horse's tail. But now what must we do for a
hook? When it came into my mind, if I could get a needle
it might soon be turned into the like shape; but as to my
own part, I very well knew I had none. However, I asked
my comrade, who, to my very great satisfaction, happened
to have a great many; and in turning the first of them, as
not very well understanding the temper of the metal, I
snapped it off in the middle, as indeed I did a second.
But now, considering within myself, that as they had been
hardened by throwing them red hot into a seasoning liquid,
unless I should again reduce them by fire to their natural
temper, I should soon break all the rest. Therefore, whilst
I was making my line, my comrade having gathered some
wood and kindled a fire (as fully intending to take up our
quarters there for that night), I put two of them between
two coals, made them red-hot, and after they were cold
enough to put my fingers to, I turned them into what
shape I pleased, so as I made two tolerable good hooks ;
and then again laying them between the coals and making
them red-hot, I threw them into water, and taking them
out again, to work I went, and in a little time caught a
tolerable dish of fish, broiled them on the coals, and with
some green figs, of which there were abundance there, we
made a very good supper.
Now, perceiving the night to draw on apace, are we busy

at work in laying on and getting more fuel, so as in a very
short time we had raised a huge fire, and fuel enough, by
way of reserve, to continue it for the night ; when I told
my comrade that I in a little time expected more company,
but such I feared as he would not by any means like.
However, I would not have him to be over afraid, for that
as we had wood sufficient to continue our fire all night,
they would not dare to approach so nigh as to do us any
harm, I having very lately sufficiently tried the experiment.
“Experiment !” said he; "of what ?” “Of what?”
said I; "of our fire preserving us from the wild beasts."
“Lord !” said he. What, are there any of them in
these parts ?” “Yes, yes," said I; "and that you will
quickly both hear and see." And, indeed, in less than
half an hour after, we plainly heard a great many of the
forerunners coming yelping towards us. “Pray,” said he,
"what are they?” “ They,” said I, "are jackals, and
the lions, tigers, &c., are not far off, and will no doubt be
soon here ;” as indeed they were, roaring and growling
after a terrible manner.
Upon which I ordered my comrade to take a large
firebrand in his hand, and to keep twirling it round his
head, and now and tben to throw it amongst them.
This did he (being not a little terrified) continue to do
all that night, our furious guests sometimes approach-
ing so near us as we could plainly distinguish them as
to their species, and many times see them engaged with
one another; insomuch that, had not an old stately lion,
to whom all the rest seemed to be under subjection,
decided their quarrels, there had no doubt been bloody
work amongst them; but wherever he interfered, they sub-
mitted to him in seeming obedience, instantly giving him
place, and, in short, all that quarter of the fire to himself.
As to my comrade, notwithstanding his being seized with

80 very great fear, yet did he seldom or never cease to
twirl his firebrand, unless when he was disposed to throw
it amongst them, and to take up a fresh one out of the
fire ; insomuch that, after our unwelcome companions had
at the approach of daylight left us, he all that day com-
plained of a grievous pain in his shoulders; though which,
he said, he was exceedingly well pleased to compound with,
for rather than run the hazard of such another night he
should be glad to endure the loss of a leg or an arm. And
now are we, indeed, both better pleased ; for, to be plain,
I did not care for their company no more than he did.
Now, after recovering ourselves of our fright, we cheer-
fully travelled on, though guilty, I think, of a very great
omission, and to ourselves very much wanting, for
though we were so very near the river and had nothing
for our breakfast, yet we did not stay to catch any fish,
which no doubt we might have done in a very little time;
but depending on our meeting with something better on
the road, we, instead thereof, were for that day obliged to
fast and to content ourselves without any the least re-
freshment. However, we travelled on with courage, and,
without anything else remarkable, we got that night,
exceeding hungry, to Ceedeachall,* directing our course to
some inhabited tent, where we at the least promised
ourselves some small refreshment. But alas! to our very
great dissatisfaction, we could get none, unless than being
admitted to lodge in one of them; and with which, not-
withstanding my hunger, I thought myself by far better
off than I did the night before, and though I saw the dogs
eating cuscassoe before my face, yet could not I, notwith-
standing I offered to pay for it, and my stomach was in
an uproar, get one pellet of it, and which was quite the
reverse of the Moorish manners of all I had ever seen

before. Therefore we very early in the morning, being
bravely refreshed by moderate sleep, set out towards
Morocco to seek our breakfast, and which being but six
leagues, and travelling at a good pace, we had by sun-
rising got over three of them, when we met a very well-
dressed genteel Moor, accoutered in martial order, having
by his side a very fine scimitar, and in his belt a pair of
pistols. He in a baughty manner demanded who we were,
from whence we came, whither bound, our business, &c.
I told him we came that morning from Ceedeachall, were
going to Morocco, and that we were by profession Chy-
rurgeons. "Chyrurgeons !” said he, "what do you mean
by that?" "That, sir," said I, “is as much as to say
surgeons, or, if you please, doctors." "Very well," said
he," and do you think you can cure my eyes ?” Which
indeed seemed to be very much inflamed. “Cure them,"
said I, " yes to be sure, though I really think them to be
very far gone, and therefore I hope you won't take it ill
if we ask your honour how much you are willing to give
us ?" "Give you ?” said he; "a very handsome fee if you
cure me : if not, nothing, unless it be to cut your throats."
“ So then," said I, “I find you are for no purchase no pay,
or rather, indeed, what is a great deal worse; however, I
dare venture it."
To be plain, I knew if I could but once get a little of
my powders into his eyes, it would be sufficiently arming
me against him and his weapons, had they been never
so many; but to be too eager upon him for the opera-
tion I thought might not be so proper, therefore I
left him alone to make the first advance. “Well, well,
then," said he, “ since I must be doctored by you, I
desire to see first if you have any money about you,"
feeling and peering into our tattered garments, and
kummaging a little knapsack the Spaniards had to carry

a few medicines in ; and though I had therein, at the
bottom of one of my pots of famous ointment, a gold
ducat and several blankeels, yet had he only his labour for
his pains, telling us “ that he thought our doctorship had
been to us, so far as he could see, of but very little
advantage hitherto; but if it had been otherwise, and
which for our sakes he should have been glad of, not-
withstanding what he had done to satisfy his curiosity,
he had no design of taking anything from us." “Alas !
sir," said I, “ you cannot, I hope, suppose we could be
under any such apprehensions. What! to be under any
apprehension of that nature from a gentleman of your
presence !” “No, no,” said be, "I hope not."
Now am I to contrive how to be up with him. However,
it soon came into my noddle, telling my comrade in
Spanish (and which I knew the Moor, as having before
tried him, did not understand) that he should be sure to
be very observant of all I told him; and then I told this
knight of the road (as being, no doubt, one of those who
make their fortunes on the ruin of others) Anglice, a
highwayman, that we were sent for in all haste to visit
some patients at Morocco, and thither we were obliged to
hasten, and therefore I wished him well, and his eyes a
better doctor. “A better doctor !” said he in a very great
passion ; "a better doctor! Pray what do you mean by
that? Did not you say you would cure me ? and I expect
you do, or I will soon spoil your doctorship.” “Cure you,
sir," said I; “how can that be, when you will not give me
leave to apply my medicines ?” “You dog," said he, “I
never told you so," laying his hand upon one of his
pistols. “Good sir," said I," be not offended, for I am
ready, when you please, to perform the operation and to
use the best of my skill.” “But do you think my eyes
are not past cure ?” “Why, sir," said I, “as to that,

I will engage to make on you a most sudden alteration, or
I will give you leave to shoot me with one of your pistols
through the head.” “ Then,” said he, "you dog, why
don't you do it, or by God, if you will not, you shall have
both.” “Sir," said I, "with all my heart."
Then I opened the knapsack, and after I had taken out
of it a paper of the powder of elebore and cod-pepper
mixed, and therewith filled two quills, giving one of them to
the Spaniard, I ordered my gentleman to sit down on the
ground; when I told the Spaniard, that when I had got
fast hold on one of his eyelids, he should be sure to take
fast hold of the other and hold it open, blow in his quill
of powder with all his might. And when we were both
ready I gave the word “ Blow," which he readily observing,
and I blowing also at the very instant, we to that degree
filled both his eyes as had our knapsack been full of gold
ducats we might have given him leave to peer therein.
The powders performed to admiration, he rubbing with
both his hands, twisting and turning, and from his eyes
flowed a little fountain of water. When I asked him how
he did, “Do," said he, "you dogs, you've blown out my
eyes !” “See now," said I, “how. men be abused for
their good will.” “Oh, burn your good will !” said he.
“Very well, sir," said I, “be that as it will, I am
thoroughly resolved to extend it a little further.” Then
laying hold on his sword and pistols, after giving him two
or three very hearty cuts by way of bleeding, I left him,
and with my comrade in all possible haste travelled on,
and about noon got to Morocco, where, would his present
circumstance bave permitted him, I thought he dared not
to come after us.
Now am I, after two months' very hazardous and painful
travel from Mequinez, safely arrived at Morocco, where,
though I had a great many acquaintances, yet would I not

venture to trust more than one of them; and finding my
comrade did not care to encounter with any more suchlike
adventures, and he had also there many friends, we, after
his giving me the knapsack and medicines, and after most
courteously bidding each other farewell, and having on
both sides agreed with ourselves what friends to call upon,
separated. And then I directly went to my friend's house,
and very luckily found him at home, and I met with a
kind reception; and he asking me what business I was come
upon, and if I thought it to be in his power to do me any
service, desiring I would not be upon the reserve, for that
I was to him very heartily welcome, and that he would
serve me even to the hazard of his life, I with a small
alteration told him the old story, as how that since Muley
Abdallah's second driving out (who, said I, you know was
very cruel, yet, between you and I, I think there is
altogether as bad come in his room, the Blacks being
become so insolent that they persuade him even to what
they please) I was between them both really in a very
great strait, and therefore I was come thither to consult
him how to act. “Indeed, my friend," said he, “I am as
well as you in this affair at a very great loss; however,
between friends, I know not which barrel of the two is the
better herring, and therefore, as you are now got so far
out of the power of them both, was your case mine, I
would depend on neither of them no longer, but take care
of myself so well as I could.” “Indeed," said I, “ that is
a very natural case, and so would I also do, could I tell
how; for, to be more plain, I as little esteem them as you
do, yet I cannot deny but it has been in my mind to follow
Muley Abdallah, and so I told my old friend, Alcayde
Woldlattabbee, in my way hither, with whom I stayed three
days." "As to that,” said he, "you did not amiss; but
what said the Alcayde to it?" "Why,” said I, " when I

had told him my inclination, and asked him which way he
would advise me to proceed, he told me that a rumour very
lately ran thereabout that the tyrant was actually gone to
Santa Cruz."
To which I answered him, that I had heard the same,
and that I was thither resolved to follow him. “Very
well,” said he, “and let your intentions be what they
would, I think you answered him very well; and once
more, my old friend, I cannot help telling you, that was
it my own case,' and you were therein sincere, I would
not follow him one step further.” “Indeed,” said I,
“ the Alcayde did not so plainly tell me to do it, neither
did he, my friend, give me any great encouragement,
though he in a friendly manner told me that I need not be
in so great a hurry, for that I should first stay with him
three or four days to refresh myself; and which, indeed, I
did, and found myself thereby, after the many misfortunes
I met with in my journey thither, very much refreshed.”
“Well, my friend,” said he, “ I am very glad the Alcayde
was so very kind to you, and that you so prudently
behaved with him; for give me leave to tell you, the times
are now so ticklish that a man cannot tell who to trust,
and in some cases it is altogether unsafe for a man to lay
himself open even to his own brother; therefore I shall be
no further inquisitive with you, and be your intentions
what they will, you are to me very sincerely welcome.
And now," said he, “I think it is high time to ask you
how your stomach may agree with a dinner.” I told him
as to that he need not fear our falling out, for that as I
had not ate anything all that day, nor the day before, it
would be to me, next himself, the best friend I could meet
with, and therefore I did not care how soon I was at it;
when he called to his wives (as having, though a Spaniard,
po less than three) to order up the cuscassoe, and come

and take part with us : "for," said he, “though it is not
the country custom, yet, as this is my brother, I hope you
will so far oblige me;" which, I assure you, was a very
extraordinary favour.
Then our dinner was by the three good wives directly
ushered in and set in the middle of the floor, which we
soon surrounded and fell to it; and, as to my own part,
I in a very short time made good my leeward way, and
made an excellent dinner indeed. And after the women
were gone off, my friend brought in a bottle of excellent
good wine to wash it down, desiring me not to spare it,
for that that bottle had a great many fellows, and there-
fore he hoped I would be as merry as he wished me.
“Alas ! my friend," said I, “how can a man be merry
under my unhappy circumstances ? However, I will force
my inclinations to be as merry as I can." And indeed
we passed the evening in taking our glass and talking
over old stories, without on either side mentioning any.
thing touching my future intentions; and as I was with my
journey somewhat weary, we, at my request, separated for
the night to our rest.
Very early in the morning he came into my apart-
ment, asking me how I had taken my rest, and telling
me that I had forgot the last night to go to supper.
“That,” said I," as you were so often pleased to ask me,
was not yours, but my own fault.” “Well,” said he,
“but can you, do you think, eat a piece of a sheep for
your breakfast ?" "Yes,” said I, “with all my heart; "
on which he brought me in a very little time a good piece
of a leg broiled on the coals, and after we had finished he
desired I would give him an account of my journey, and
how long I had been on it. “Do you mean,” said I,
“after a methodical manner ?" "Yes," said he, “if you
don't think it too tedious for you.” “Alas ! my friend,"

said I, “I hope you do not think there can be anything in
my power too tedious for me to oblige you in." Then I,
from Mequinez to my burnt and scarified patient, gave him
a very particular account, and when I came to him I
seemed a little to mince the matter; however, as I had
promised him to tell him the truth, so I did, and when
I came to the torturing part he asked me how I could be so
cruel. “Cruel," said I, "just so (were it in my power)
I would use most of the Moors in Barbary.” “Ha, ha,"
said he, “now do I, without your telling me plainly, see
through your intentions; but go on."
Then I told him what a terrible fright I was in on one of
his sons coming to the Alcayde's house, whilst I was there,
to tell him his father was dead, that the doctor had killed
him, and that could he catch him he would soon spoil his
doctorship; which made him laugh very heartily. And
when I was come to my taking up my quarters amongst
the wild beasts, he altogether as heartily mourned my con-
dition ; however, I soon put him again in good humour by
my telling him the dialogue between me and my scour-road
sore-eyed patient, and which really pleased him very much,
laughing as though he had been tickled (though I told him
then never a word of my bringing off his sword and pistols),
telling me that by the description I gave of him he must
be actually the same who had infested the roads for a long
time back, insomuch as very few travellers escaped him.
“ But,” said he,“ did not the villain cry out ?" “ Yes,
yes,” said I, “ so well as he could ; and now, sir, give me
leave to ask you what you, through your very great
clemency, would have done by him had it been your own
case.” “Done by him ?" said he ; " with his own sword
cut his throat.” “Indeed, sir," said I, “ that is what you
might soon have done, it being actually a very good one,
and the pistols not at all inferior to it; and which, if you

will not believe me, be your own eyes the judge," taking
them from underneath my old blanket.
At which he said he was very much surprised, for that he
had not, to his mind, of a long time seen finer, and that he
thought them to be of considerable value. I told him that
I was very glad he liked them so well, and that if he was
pleased to accept of anything which formerly belonged to a
highwayman, they were very heartily at his service; and
as to their late masters finding them upon him, he needed
not to be under the least apprehension. With much ado he
took them as his own, though first indeed he, by way of old
friendship, compelled me to accept of three gold ducats,
and which, he said, he was determined to give me had he
not seen the sword and pistols at all. And after dinner,
and drinking a hearty bottle, I told him, just as I was
going to lie down, that I would not by any means have him
to take it ill, for that I was fully determined with myself to
pursue my journey early in the morning; and getting up
accordingly I (after a good breakfast, and receiving from
him three cakes of bread, some snuff, and very friendly
advice, telling me he was fully apprised of my intentions,
that he sincerely wished me well to my own country, and
that God would be to me therein aiding and assisting,
taking me in his arms, and giving me a very hearty and
I dare say sincere kiss, which I without any further answer
as sincerely returning) departed; and as I travelled at a
pretty smart rate I got that forenoon about ten of the
clock to Tamslaught,* where I rested me so long as to eat
a few grapes with some of my bread for my dinner, and,
travelling on, I got about one that afternoon to a part of
the river Waddenfeeze, where I sat me down again, and
began to consult myself if I should go directly on or stay
there so long as to catch a few fishes; for notwithstanding

I had so lately dined, yet methought I could (as the grapes
had but whetted my stomach) find in my heart to make
another dinner. Therefore I went to work, and caught a
brace of tolerable size in a very short time, and on my
seeing some Moors coming to the riverside I hailed one of
them (as being loath to be too profuse of my tinder), and
asked him if he could help me to a coal of fire; and which,
whilst he was fetching from one of their tents, I had
gathered a few dry sticks and laid them in order, and
whilst I was cleaning my fish he came with the fire and
kindled the wood, and then I laid my fish thereon and
made a very hearty meal, and some to spare to my
attendant.
And I being surrounded by this time with several other
Moors, they were soon very inquisitive with me to know
the guts of my knapsack. Alas! thinks I, these are
not, I hope, some of the under-strappers of my late sore-
eyed patient; but indeed I was soon given to understand
the contrary, for on my being asked a second time I told
them medicines for curing the sick ; when I was asked by
one of them if I could cure sore eyes. “Sore eyes ? " said
I;" yes, I think I have hitherto cured a great many, and a
gentleman in particular, about three days ago, of a very
great inflammation therein.” “An inflammation,” said
he; “pray what do you mean by that?” “Why," said I,
" that is when the eyes are attended with a hot scalding
pain, and look of a very red colour.” “ Then as sure as
daylight," said he,“ my brother's are just so." "" And so
are my sister's," said another. “And my wife's," said
another. “But,” said they,“ do you really think you can
cure them?” “That,” said I, “I cannot say; first let me
see them, and then I will tell you more of my mind, for the
gentleman the other day was also very inquisitive, and
asked me much the same questions, and notwithstanding

his eyes were really very much inflamed, yet did I make on
him so great an alteration as to leave him quite another
man in a very little time.” “Will you then, doctor, be
pleased to go with us to yonder tents ?" said they. “Yes,"
said I, “ if you please, with all my heart ;” and at our
coming up were brought out of two of them a man and two
women, having in their eyes what I had often heard in my
childhood called amongst the old women in England a
“blast.”
“ Alas !” said I, “how came you to suffer this in.
veterate disease to reign on you so long?” “Indeed,
doctor," said they, “ to tell you the truth, we thought (as
well as a great many of our neighbours who had the same
distemper) to be well again in a very little time, as indeed
they were in less than a fortnight.” “Wby,” said I,
“yours, or I am very much mistaken, has been coming on
you more than a month.” “Yes, doctor," said the man,
“more than six weeks.” “Very well,” said I, "and are
you resolved to make trial of my medicines, or suffer it to
run on longer ? If you are resolved to put yourselves
under my care, tell me directly, for I am obliged to go this
evening, or to-morrow early, to a patient about two leagues
off, and, as far as I can tell, when I come back it may be
too late. However, as to that, as your eyes are your own,
you may do as you please by them.” “Good doctor,"
said they, “don't be uneasy, for you shall try your skill on
us before you go.” “Very well,” said I, “but before I
meddle with your eyes I design to give you a small matter
of my purging powders, the better to prepare you for the
operations; and as the eyes are at this time of day very
dangerous to meddle with, I will give you the physic
directly, and take in hand your eyes in the morning, for,
to be plain with you, in many cases of the eyes the light
cannot, no more than our tempers, be too calm and

serene." " That,” said they, “ doctor, you know better
than we do, and therefore we are very willing to conform
ourselves to your rules.” “Very well,” said I (as having
a very great mind to a good supper), “and have you then
in either of your tents any fresh mutton? In short, if you
have not, you must look out for some ;” when a messenger
was sent to a neighbouring tent, and soon returned with a
fore-quarter, asking me how I would have it dressed.
“Dressed," said I; “I suppose now you think I ordered
this only for myself; be that as it will, I heartily thank
you, and set the pot over directly, for I shall want the
broth for working the physic; but,” said I, " be sure you
put in all the meat, for the stronger it is I think it will be
far the better."
So when I saw the mutton under sail I gave to each
of them a small dose of my bitter apples in some honey,
which I knew to be sufficient, and that it could in no
wise hurt them, charging them to keep continually walk-
ing and stirring their bodies; and whilst the physic was
performing its several parts came in a woman, to whom
the people of the family spoke very courteou sly, asking
her how she did. “Do," said she, “neighbours, very
bad, and really I think very bad indeed.” “Alas! poor
woman,” said they, “pray how long have you been so,
and what may your distemper be, for we have observed
you ailing for a long time?” “That," said she, “is what
I cannot very well tell, though I am almost persuaded by
some people that it is what the doctors call a dropsy. It
has been coming on me now almost twelve months, and is,
instead of the least appearance of amendment, I think still
growing worse and worse, insomuch that I am to that
degree swelled that my skin is ready to burst; but neigh-
bours, I am told you have a doctor in the house, and to
whom I am come to ask him if he can do me any good.”

Then one of the family told her there was the doctor,
pointing at me-of which I seemed to take no notice,
though you may suppose I heard every word they said ;
neither did I till she came to me so well as she could, and
asked me if I thought I could do her any good. “Any
good,” said I, looking her full in the face, “pray what ails
you ?” “Ail me,” said she, " enough I think.” “ Pray,"
said I, "give me your hand," and after I had felt her
pulse, and looked at her legs, felt her chest, &c., I told her
that I thought it a most unaccountable thing that people
should be so very careless of their health, and only for the
sake of saving a little money to suffer such inveterate dis-
tempers to reign so long upon them; which, said I, is just
the same with breaking your necks only for the humour of
trying the skill of the doctor to set it. “However," said I,
“I will do for you all in my power.” “All in your power,”
said she. “Yes," said I, "all in my power. You would
not have me to promise you further than I think may be
performed by second means; and that, I say, I am ready,
if you please, to put in practice.” “Pray," said she,
“what do you think my distemper to be ?” “To be ? "
said I; "a dropsy, an old, confirmed, inveterate dropsy."
“Indeed !” said she, “and so I did suppose it.” “Why,"
said I, “I warrant it has been coming on you now more
than twelve months.” “Why really, doctor,” said she,
“ you are very much in the right of it; and was I as sure
of a cure as that you have hit my distemper, I would with
all my heart give you twenty gold ducats.” “Well," said
I, “ have a good heart, take this evening, by way of pre-
paring the body, a small paper of my purging powder, and
to-morrow morning early I will take from you some water,
of which, let me tell you, you have in your body not a
little.” So I gave her a paper of my powders, ordered her
to go home and take it in a little honey, and to work it

with water gruel, for that broth was by no means fit for
her.
And then indeed my stomach put me in mind of my
own supper, and after my patients had pretty well thrown
off their physic, and the mutton was fully boiled, I ordered
each of them a large dish of the broth, when I also fell at
it myself, and between the broth and the meat I soon made
& very hearty supper; and then I told my patients they
might also eat a little of the meat if they would, and that
they should immediately after it go to their rest, for that I
intended to rouse them very early in the morning, and that
in order thereto I would, if they pleased, also lay me down
and take a nap. And at daybreak I got up and went to my
dropsy patient, asking her how she did, and if she found
herself, after her physic, for the better or the worse. “As
to that,” said she, “ it has made on me no great matter of
alteration; however, I am fully satisfied it has done me no
harm.” “Very well,” said I, “and as I am just now
obliged to be going away, I desire you will tell me if you
are willing I should touch you first in two or three places
in the stomach with a hot iron.” “Good doctor,” said
she, “cannot you cure me by any other means ?” “No,"
said I, "there is no other means that I know of, unless you
will give me leave to make a large hole in your stomach
and put in a tap.” “Well,” said she, “burning will no
doubt be very painful to me; however, I had rather suffer
that than the boring a hole through my belly.” “Very
well," said I, "and I think you are very much in the right
of it, for I would have you to consider if it is not better for
you to smart once than always to ache; besides, you know
very well that a desperate disease must have a desperate
cure." "Indeed, doctor,” said she, "all you say is very
true, therefore do by me just as you please.”
Then I put my iron into the fire, made it hot, and burnt
17

her in the stomach in three several places, and there actually
came out a great deal of yellow water, and after I had given
her a piece of my plaster, and directed her how to use it, I
told her I must be going, and that if she would spare me a
small matter of money to defray my expenses till I came
back I should think myself very much obliged to her.
“Pray,” said she, “how long do you think you may be
wanting ?” “Really,” said I, " that I cannot very well
tell; it may be one, two, or three days, according to the
condition I find my patients in.” “Alas !” said she, “and
what shall I do in your absence ?” “Do !" said I, “ was
I here I could do no more for you for three or four days
than keep drawing plasters to the burnt part, and that you
may do, or anybody else for you, as you may see occasion
to change them, and by the time I come back I do not
doubt but there will be on you a very great alteration."
Then she gave me a gold ducat, with which, after bidding
her for the time farewell, I went directly to my sore-eyed
gentry, who were all waiting my coming, and ready to
undergo the operations; however, before I took them in
hand, as not thinking it convenient for me to stay there
any longer after I had doctored them, and having, before I
left them, a very great mind to a good breakfast, I asked
them if they had ate anything for the morning. They told
me no, for that notwithstanding they were after their
physic extremely hungry, yet would they not venture to eat
anything till I came. “Very well,” said I, “ as to that I
cannot blame you; however, if you have any cold meat
left, I would by all means have you to eat a little before I
take you in hand, for, to be plain with you, you will not
for some time after the operation be able to see so well how
to go about it."
Then the remains of our last night's supper was directly
brought forth, and when I had filled my belly I told them


## p. 259 (#285) ############################################

ADVENTURES OF THOMAS PELLOW. 259
I was ready as soon as they pleased. They directly left
eating, and according to order sat themselves all down
on the floor, and then I, in a little time (it being my
masterpiece, and I having several quills of my powders
ready at my hands), filled all their eyes to that degree
as to set them a wallowing and getting upon their legs,
capering and dancing like so many fairies; when I told
them that they must have patience, for that the violent
smarting would soon pass off, and that as I was obliged,
as I told them the last night, to go to a patient about
two leagues off, I could then tarry with them no longer;
therefore, said I, if you will be pleased to help me to a
little money to bear out my expenses till I return you
will very much oblige me; and if I did not at my return
make on them a perfect cure, I would on my honour give it
them back again. Then they ordered one of the women to
give me a gold ducat; and which, indeed, they could not
do themselves, they being by that time on the rubbing and
twisting order, and such abundance of tears falling from
their eyes, that had it been by way of a natural cause, and
in contrition for their past sins, it must, no doubt, have
been accounted a very happy introduction to their future
repentance.*

story. In answer to which he told me that, so far as he
could learn thitherto, Muley Abdallah was at Taffilet.

him, or at least heard a further certainty where he is."
“ Very well,” said he, “but I would have you to tarry here
first some time with me, to refresh yourself, during which
we may chance to hear of him further.” I told him that I
was very much obliged to him for his civility, and that as
he was pleased to be so very kind as to offer me so great a
favour in my distress, I was ready with all my heart (as I
was through my great travel very much harassed) to accept
of it; and, in short, I stayed with him three days, during
which (he being very inquisitive after my journey) I gave
him an account of it, so far as I thought proper to let him
know, and practised on several patients by his permission,
and amongst them all rose to the value of twenty shillings
English.
The third following morning very early (I having over-
night acquainted him with my intentions, and received
from him a gold ducat to help me forward, and his most
hearty, and, as he said, sincere obedience and good wishes
for Muley Abdallah, all which he desired me to make ac-
ceptable to him, so far as it might be in my power) I took
my departure thence, and travelled up the mountain as fast
as I could, though seriously considering with myself if it
might be proper or not for me to rest myself at the castle
of Ehiah Embelide, where I had been before to the then
inhabitants a very bitter enemy. Therefore I had with
myself a very great debate for some time concerning it; as
how (many years having since passed) they might be all

then dead, thence removed, or their remembrance of me
quite worn out; to which I was by myself answered, what
occasion had I to run any such hazard ? For that I was
then fresh, and very well able to perform without it; and
therefore I agreed to give the castle the go by, and to travel
on till I had gained the height; and I climbed up as fast as
I could, till I had got within sight of the four little towns
we had formerly destroyed, together with all the men in.
habitants ; when I had again with myself for some short
time another debate, if it might not be hazardous for me to
pass through them.
However (on considering the men then there to be
all strangers, or at least to be grown up during my
absence, those formerly there being all to my knowledge
dead, that the children then spared there did not exceed
ten years of age, and that the women who were then
also spared must no doubt be then under so grievous
and terrifying a consternation as not to be capable of
taking any notice of faces, by way of their making future
reprisals, or of my sweet phiz in particular), I passed
through without saluting any of the inhabitants, no further
than my asking a lad whom I saw there with some almonds
and raisins in a basket, how he sold them, and buying a
halfpennyworth of them, I travelled on down the mountain
on the other side, and about sunset got clear of it, getting
to another part of the river Waddonfeese, where I was for
the night tolerably well entertained in a Moor's tent, though
I had from him a very deplorable account concerning the
very late state of that neighbourhood, as how the country
was to that degree destroyed, and in such confusion, that
they and they only who happened to be of the strongest
party were accounted the happy people, and of whom I
soon found he had been so happy to be one. “Then,” said
I, “it is no doubt very dangerous for a stranger to be

amongst you." "That indeed," said he,"is according to
his behaviour, and the nature of his business which calleth
· him thither, or which party he sides with.” “Why, sir,”
said I, " as to my part I have no further business here
than to sell a few medicines amongst you, if I can, for the
benefit of you all, without meddling with your quarrels on
either side.” “Why really,” said he, "you say very well,
and I wish you success with all my heart; but, to be plain
with you, we have been of late so far involved in a civil
war, that one parish was up against another in arms,
destroying the fruit of each other's labour, and cutting one
another's throats so fast as they could.” “Alas!" said I,
"a very unhappy case indeed !” To which he answered
me, that I should not be under any uneasiness at it, but
endeavour to compose myself, for that he would in the
morning put me into the best method he could.
However, I could not (notwithstanding his fair promises,
and though I was prodigious weary) take any rest for the
first part of the night, still wishing myself further off; when
I told myself, that as it was my chance to come there, it
would be in vain for me to vex myself, but endeavour to get
thence again as well as I could. So I fell into a sound sleep,
and slept till sunrising; then I got up, and saluting my host
with a good-morrow, and telling him that I thought myself
very much obliged to him for my kind welcome, and if he
was pleased to accept of any of my medicines, they were
very heartily at his service. “No, no," said he," you are
very welcome to what you have had here; and as to physic,
I never took any in my life, and unless I may happen to
have more occasion for it than I have had hitherto, I never
will take any. But what makes you in so much hurry? If
I want none, there are those amongst us to my knowledge
that do, and who, no doubt, when they hear you are come,
will be very glad of it; and as to your safety amongst us

(as our civil dissensions are now at an end) here is my
band,” giving it in a very friendly manner into mine, and
asking me where I intended to go.
“As to that, sir," said I, “I am not very well deter-
mined whether to Terrident or Taffilet.” “ Then,” said
be, “I tell you on my honour that both those roads are
very unsafe, and dangerous to travel in at present, for
after our several conflicts in these parts, they are now,
by our example, acting the same in them : therefore stay
with me till those bickerings are over, till which you
shall be very welcome in my house to such as I have."
“Sir," said I, “I most humbly thank you,” and which,
indeed, I was obliged to accept of; for that very day came
thither repeated advices that there was in and throughout
both those provinces (which are much the same with
our counties) very grievous doings, insomuch that they
were killing and plundering all they could lay their hands
on. So that I was obliged to take up my quarters with this
hospitable infidel during the space of twenty-four days ;
during which I had several patients, and amongst them all
got about forty shillings sterling, acting after a most
cautious manner, in giving such small doses of my purging
powder as I knew could do them no harm; and as I was so
lucky to perform nothing by way of curing the eyes, I gave
general satisfaction. In short, got amongst them so famous
a name, as I presume none of the quack fraternity had
ever done before me. They really had so good an opinion
of me, that on another of the fraternity's coming one day
there, and though he might, for anything as I knew to the
contrary, have been a very able man, yet did they (on my
seeming indifference of him) directly drive him thence,
threatening him, that in case they ever caught him there
again, they would cut off his ears.
Now am I, by the general approbation and consent, on

promise of my being back again in three weeks, and on
their hearing the roads were again passable, permitted to
depart, taking my way for Arhallah, in the plain of Souz;
and without anything remarkable, I arrived the second
following evening at a place called in their .language Ros-
selelwad, or the head of the old river, thoroughly resolving
to get that night, if I could, to Terrident. And which,
indeed, had not that part of the journey proved most un-
fortunate to me, I should have reached before the gates
were shut, I being about ten o'clock at night within half a
mile of it; when I was surprised by three ruffian Moors,
knocked down, plundered, and, in short, deprived of every-
thing I had in the world, stripping me quite naked ; and
rummaging into my blanket, they soon found my blankeels,
which, as the moon was then at the full, and the horizon
very clear, I saw to my very great dissatisfaction.
When I saw them ransacking my knapsack, I was really
terrified a great deal more, I baving hid all my gold at the
bottom of one of my pots of ointment, in all to the value of
six pounds sterling. But I had so far the presence of
mind as to tell them that they could not be anything the
better for the few medicines I had in it, but (as they did
not know how to use them) rather the worse, though they
would be to me, by way of my getting a small matter for
my subsistence, of very great service. And as my life de-
pended thereon, I hoped they would be pleased to give me
my blanket, knapsack, and few medicines back again,
which, as they had taken from me all my money, would in
all likelihood keep me from starving. “No, no," said
they, “you have got your life, and go therewith about
your business." Then I very much complained of the cold,
and of the many wounds I had about me, desiring them
that if they would not give me back my medicines, they
would at least give me a pot of my ointment. “No, no,"

266 ADVENTURES OF THOMAS PELLOW.
said they, "for if your ointment is so very excellent for
your wounds, pray why is it not for ours ? ” “ However,"
said one of them, “ here take your blanket, and be packing
about your business, or you will oblige us to be very angry
with you.” To which another of them added, that I was
an unconscionable dog, and if I said another word, he
would take my blanket from me again. “Then pray, gen.
tlemen," said I, "if you will not give me a whole pot, give
me a small matter of the ointment at the bottom of one of
them.” “You dog," said they, "you shall have none; and
if you dare speak another word, we will cut off your ears."
At which they went directly from me, and without speaking
another word on either side, left me to consider the folly of
heaping up riches, as not knowing who shall gather them.
And now am I obliged to travel empty away for
Terrident, as you may suppose, in a very disconsolate
manner; and in walking but a slow pace, I got in half an
hour's time to the gates of the city, which I found to be
shut, and all within very silent, therefore I found myself
obliged to lay me down in one of their burying-places,
amongst the graves, where I continued till daylight, re-
Alecting on my so late misfortune. Then I got me up, and
kept walking till the sun was up, and the gates were opened,
when I marched in, and went directly to a friend's house, a
Frenchman, we being formerly fellow-soldiers, and always
very intimate with one another. I was directly admitted
entrance, and very courteously received by him, telling me
that he was very glad to see me, but to see me there at
that time very sorry. “Why,” said I, “what is the
matter? I hope there are not more evils soon about to
befall me; if so, I think it will be a very unhappy time
indeed," telling him of my so late misfortunes. “Alas !
my friend,” said he, "that is what I did not dream of, and
I am sincerely sorry for you; but what I meant by saying

80, was tending to matters of another nature, and which is
indeed quite different." “Pray," said I, “what may it
be ?" "Be ? " said he ; " you must know that here is now
in the town Abdallah Mahomet, one of old Muley Smine's
natural sons, who hath lately gained to his interest at least
one hundred thousand of the mountaineers, and was with
them about two months ago at Santa Cruz, took it, and,
with a good part of the country round, brought it under his
subjection, and is now forcing all able-bodied men, who will
not voluntarily come into his service. Therefore I think
it (till he is departed hence) highly necessary for you to
remain secretly in my house ; for should he or any of his
people happen to see you, you would no doubt be obliged
to follow him.” “And whither," said I, “ does he design
to go, or what may be his intentions ?” “That indeed,"
said he, “I cannot particularly tell you, but first you may
suppose he will strengthen his party all he can, and then
most likely make a bold push against Mabommet Wol-
derriva, and the Black Army, for the Empire.” “Indeed!”
said I; “then I find my wishes are still every day more and
more coming about, for if natural sons thus presume, where
there are so many born under wedlock, there will be no
doubt amongst them all (as they are so many hundreds)
rare work in a very little time. Therefore all I shall say
further to it for the present is, ‘May God increase their
animosities, and send me from amongst them.'" “In-
deed, my friend,” said he,“ happy are those who are out of
it; and as to us, we have already acted our parts very suffi-
ciently in their bloody enterprises."
Then I returned again to my late misfortune, telling
my friend, that in regard to my future proceedings, I
thought the loss of my knapsack and medicines to be
(amongst all my losses) the greatest. "Well," said he,
“I suppose I guess what you mean, and it shall go

very hard, if I do not in a very little time procure
you some other,” which indeed he did the next day,
and then he also told me that he had been credibly in-
formed that morning, that Abdallah Mahomet was fully
determined to march the day after with all his people for
Morocco.” “Very well," said I," and I the next for Santa
Cruz.” “ Prithee," said he,“ don't be so very hasty ; we may
not perhaps see one another again of a long time, therefore
pray oblige me with your company now as long as you
can.” “Very well,” said I, “and so I will ; " as indeed I
did till the third morning, when, after our taking our leave
of each other, I departed with my knapsack, a few
medicines, and six blankeels. And it being a very
dangerous part of the country to travel through, I
travelled on all day without intermission, and got about
sunset to Terroost, a village in the parish of Gisseemah,
near the river Souz, about three leagues short of Santa
Cruz, where luckily meeting with two of my old acquaint-
ance, I was entertained by them very friendly all that
night; and setting out thence very early the next morning,
I about ten o'clock that forenoon got well to Santa Cruz,
where being before well acquainted, I was kindly received
by the inhabitants, and treated for two days after a most
friendly manner. Yet I did not think fit to lodge in the
town, but retired at nights to a cave about a musket-shot
without, where I had several Moors and two Blacks for my
companions; and returning again at sunrising into the
town, where, as not altogether caring to rely myself on my
friends, I sought out an employ, and was hired by a baker
to carry his bread round the town to his customers, through
which means I got a sufficient subsistence, all this time
looking sharp out for a vessel ; and though I found several,
yet could I not meet with any so Christian-like commander
as on any terms to carry me with him.

However, I did not despair, for notwithstanding my
present state, and no hopes of a vessel at that time, yet did
my mind daily tell me that my captivity was running out
apace, and my nocturnal imaginations were sufficiently
stuffed with foolish idle fancies and dreams about it, inso-
much that I was not a little afraid that I should thereby let
my companions know my designs. For they often told me
how I cried out in my sleep, and mentioned Gibraltar
(where, indeed, there was scarce a night passed without
my dreaming of my being safely landed); and as at my
awaking I very particularly remembered it, and took
notice that my comrades began to prate amongst them-
selves concerning it, therefore I one day, as it were acci-
dentally, began the following discourse with them. “ Pray,
gentlemen," said I, “is any one of you a good interpreter
of dreams ?” “Not I,” said one ; "Nor I," said another;
and, in short, so said they all. “However, lay them before
us," said they, “ for if we cannot come up to the true inter-
pretation, it will be still doing no harm."
And I having before duly considered my story, I told them
that I had for several nights past been strangely hurried in
my sleep by dreams, as how that Muley Abdallah should be
fled to Gibraltar, that he was there kindly received by the
Christians, and that we were all going with Mahomet
Wolderriva to bring him back. Nay, further, that we went,
and that at our arrival we were met by one of the most
stately lions I had ever seen before, and by him driven
back again, threatening Mahomet after a high rate, that in
case he ever caught him or the Spaniard there again, he
would send them in chains to his royal master, to be ex-
posed to public view amongst the other outlandish
monsters in the Tower of London. This, I hope, though
altogether false, my readers will not impute to my love for
romance, and disregard for truth, when they have duly

weighed the circumstances that induced me to it, but
consider it, as it was really intended, to take off the edge
of those inquisitive wretches from talking any further
about what I talked in my sleep; and having told them this
strange fiction, they said they could not tell what to make
of it, and could not but allow it to be a very extraordinary
and most unaccountable dream.
Now, being still without any likelihood of meeting with
a ship, I am thoroughly resolved to forsake my cave, and
seek farther, telling my comrades that as I was somewhat
apprehensive I had worn out my welcome at Santa Cruz,
I would first go thither to thank them for all past favours,
and then travel farther by way of serving the country with
my medicines. The second following morning, meeting
there in the street a German, one of the quack fraternity,
I soon insinuated myself so far into his favours as to get
him to promise me to go with me; and the next morning
we accordingly set out, and travelled back the three leagues
to Terroost, on the river Souz, where I lodged the night
before I came into Santa Cruz. Now we begun to open
the many strange and wonderful cures we had performed
by way of our doctorship, insomuch that we had at the
village of Terroost, and up and down the parish of Gissee-
mah, great business for a week's time. But, alas ! what
could all that avail me. Indeed, it was with much hazard,
present bread. But on my duly cousidering the many
hazards and difficulties I had undergone to get thither, and
that my former practices that way were altogether on
account of the better concealing my escape, and that as
I had behaved with so much caution in my travels through
80 many dangerous and roundabout tiresome ways, ingo-
much that I was obliged from Mequinez to Santa Cruz to
make of it more than six months' journey. Whereas I might
by travelling the direct road have performed it in thrice as

ADVENTURES OF THOMAS PELLOW. 271
many days, and all for the better keeping my intentions
from suspicion therefore as I had thereby so far accom-
plished my desired ends, I really thought my business now
to be of a quite different nature than practising physic, and
that notwithstanding there was no ship for my purpose
whilst I was at Santa Cruz, yet I could not tell how soon
there might.
I had been from thence a week, during which there
might happen to come in several, therefore I plainly
told myself that where I was then I had no business,
and therefore it was by no means consistent with
my unhappy condition, and that I ought to make the
best of my way to Santa Cruz again, or some other sea-
port. However, on my seeing vast troops of wild-fowl on
the river, I thought if I could get a few of them they might
be to my friends at Santa Cruz a very acceptable present.
But how to get them was the chief point. Gun nor ammu-
nition I had none, nor where to get any I did not know.
However, I was through very great luck provided with them
both in a very little time, and that night I went to the
riverside, and as the moon shone very bright, I saw a vast
number of them swimming on the water in a still part of
the river ; and levelling amongst them as well as I could,
I fired and killed four couple of ducks. Then, throwing off
my blanket, I threw myself into the river, and soon brought
them out, and I retired for the night to my rest, and
lay me down by my comrade, telling him of my success,
and that I designed in the morning to present them to my
friends at Santa Cruz, and that if he would go with me
I would dare engage to make him very welcome. “No,"
said he, “I am fully determined in the morning to go
another way, and as I find you are designed to leave me,
I wish you very well.” And after taking a short nap, and
the daylight appearing, we started up and set out, he to

seek after fresh patients one way, and I another to Santa
Cruz with my ducks ; where I was very kindly received by
the merchants, and handsomely rewarded for my fowl, but
finding no ship for my purpose, I returned again to the
river, killed more fowl, carried them to Santa Cruz, and
sold them at a good rate. And after I had recruited my
ammunition, I went back again, and so continued in going
and coming for several weeks, by which time the winter
was pretty well past—though all this time, to my very
great dissatisfaction, no ship.
This trade of duck-killing I found to turn to a much
better account than my former business, and to kill them,
rather than the Moors, much the safer way; though it was
attended with some hardships and very severe cold, yet as
my present condition was so very unhappy in the general,
I thought myself very well off in it.
Now is the spring approaching apace; therefore, as
I had been so long in and out about Santa Cruz, looking
out after a vessel, and all to no purpose, I was fully
determined with myself to try what might be done that
way at Saphee, and in case I could not be there successful
to travel on to the Willadea. And meeting soon after
a Spaniard, one of my old acquaintance, I thought if
I could get him to go with me it might not be amiss ; but
he in very little time saved me that trouble, telling me
that in case he had not happened to meet me there, he
should have been at that time at least a league on his way.
“On your way,” said I; “pray whither may you be going
to ?” “Going to?" said he; "a long journey, and as I
hear a very troublesome one." “Pray,” said I, “ to what
part of the country?” “Why," said he, "to Saphee.”
" To Saphee," said I; " that is a place I have had very
great inclination to see for some time, therefore, had I any
business there, or was I sure to get by it but one single

blankeel, I would go with you. “Why, said he, “ if you
are in good earnest, and your business will permit you,
I will bear out your expenses on the road, and be helpful
to you in everything else that I can.” “Very well,” said
I,“ have a care I don't take you at your word; for to be
plain with you, you don't know how far you have brought
me in the mind of it, and as I have very little to do here,
a very little further persuasion may prevail.” “Well
then," said he,“ we will first go to my friend's house, and
take a bottle upon it, and by the time we have finished it,
your resolutions may be better settled.” As indeed they
were, before our bottle was half out, giving him my word to
go with him; at which he seemed, and was I dare say, very
glad, telling me that as it was so far onward in the after-
noon, he thought it would be the best way for us to set up
there for the night, and so set out early in the morning.
Then he ordered for a good supper, after which we drank
two bottles more, and went to our rest.
Now am I really better pleased than I had been of a long
time before, and as soon as the morning light appeared,
I got up; and by the time I had stepped to the door to
look at the weather and in again, my comrade was up also,
and after making a good breakfast, and taking with us
about six pounds of bread, we set forward together, and
got that evening without any disaster to Agroot, the little
fishing-coves before mentioned, in my travel with the
caravan to Guinea, where we met two Moors just arrived
before us from Hahah, a parish about a day's journey
in our way farther on towards Saphee,* and which we
must be obliged to pass through the next day, who
told us that the inhabitants of a neighbouring parish
to them were up in arms against them, and proving
much too strong for their parish they were obliged to fly

for their lives, the greatest part of them being destroyed,
and that throughout all that province were the like doings.
This so terrified my comrade that, notwithstanding his so
very great hurry for Saphee, and my cheering him all in
my power, yet could not I persuade him to go with me but
very little farther. However, I so far prevailed with him
as to continue with me there for that night, and then I
thought it high time to look about me for something for
supper ; but there being nothing to be had, we took out our
bread and fell at it, and whilst we were eating a Moor
came up to us, desiring us to look at his eyes. “Your
eyes," said I,“ pray what ails them ?" and laying one of
my fingers on one of his eyelids. “So, so,” said I, "you
are coming blind apace; but,” said I, “I cannot see
what encouragement travellers can have to do any good,
where nothing is to be had to keep them from starving."
“Nothing !” said he; “notwithstanding my eyes are so
very bad, I see you have got very good bread.” “Yes,”
said I," and so we have, but without any thanks to you or
any of your neighbours, for we brought it with us from
Santa Cruz.” “Indeed!” said he; " then I will tell you
for your comfort, if you will look at my eyes, and help me
all in your power, I will give you a dried haike and some
very good oil.” “Very well," said I; " you speak like an
honest man, and therefore pray hasten and show yourself
so, and after supper we will do somewhat for you."
And which, indeed, he did in good earnest, bringing
us a middling haike, and about a pint of oil, and making us
a fire broiled the fish, and we soon made a very hearty
supper on it; when we gave him a paper of our purging
powders to prepare his body against the morning, and lay
us down under a fig-tree in the court for the night. At
daybreak we got up, and without doing any further
mischief to our last night's benefactor, we set out and

travelled on farther together about two leagues, which
brought us to the foot of the mountain Gorrasurnee, where
the Spaniard's heart failing him, he told me plainly that
he would not for that time travel on any farther in that
road, was be sure to get by it a hundred ducats, but that
he was resolved to return again to his house at Terrident,
till the country was again a little better settled, and if
I would go with him I should on his honour be very
heartily welcome. I told him that I altogether as heartily
thanked him, but as I was got over my journey so far
I was thoroughly resolved to see it out, be the consequence
what it would. So after sharing our little bread and few
medicines we parted, him back towards Terrident, and
I forwards towards Saphee, travelling up the mountain
as fast as I could, though before I had got quite at the
top of it, I very unhappily met with four ruffian Moors
armed with muskets, and long murdering knives, who
immediately, without asking me any the least question,
fell to rifling me, stripped me quite naked, and were going
off with my knapsack and blanket, when I earnestly
intreated them to give me them back again, for that I had
nothing else to depend on for a livelihood but a few
medicines I had therein, and nothing to cover me from the
inclemency of the air but that old garment. “You lie,
you rascal," said one of them, “it is a very good one, and
therefore you shall not have it.” “ Pray then, sir,” said
I, “let me have my knapsack.” “Ay, ay," says another,
" let him have it, for it can be of no benefit to us, and
may very likely keep him from starving."
So through the means of a conscientious thief I had
my knapsack and few medicines back again. I then
travelled on quite naked till I had got two leagues
farther up the mountain, where I, to my great satis-
faction, came to three houses, out of one of which came

an old woman, who seemed to pity my condition very
much, and gave me a piece of an old blanket, a
dish of buttermilk, and some “jerrodes” or locusts,
with which they are visited once in six or seven years
to that degree, swarming in from seaward upon them
in incredible multitudes, as even to darken the air, and
at once overspreading a province, eat up every green
leaf and herb, so that the fields and trees look all one as
they do in the bleakest winter. These insects are not only
innumerable, but of a large size, some of them at least
two inches long, and about the bigness of a man's thumb.
They are really good eating, and in taste most like shrimps,
and are by the inhabitants, first purging them with water
and salt, boiled in new pickle, and then laid up in dry salt
by way of reserve.
After this good woman had thus kindly used me, and
given me some more of the jerrodes to carry with me,
one of her neighbours happening to come by, and taking
also some pity on me, gave me a piece of another old
blanket, so as I was between them both pretty well
covered again, and really thought myself well off, travel-
ling cheerfully on to the house of an old acquaintance,
by trade a shoemaker, who made me very welcome, took
off from me my old rags, and gave me a very good blanket;
and as he knew I fully intended to stay with him for the
night, he ordered his wife to get ready some cuscassoe for
my supper, and in the morning for my breakfast some
“ Zumineeta," * which is barley roasted in a pan oper the
fire, much in like nature of coffee, then it is ground down
by a hand-mill, and after it is clean from the bran it is
mixed with water, and is very often carried with them in a
little bag to their labour or on a journey, and when they
are disposed to refresh themselves, they take out some of
* Zesomeeta, or Zummeeta.

this zumineeta into a little cup they generally carry with
them for that purpose, mix it with some water, and drink
it off, being much after the Scotch fashion-with this only
difference, that being plain oatmeal, this, barley roasted;
and on this I travelled all that day, getting towards night
to the parish of Idogurt,* where I very luckily happened
to meet with a very friendly and hospitable house, getting a
good supper and lodging, and the next morning a good
breakfast. I travelled merrily on all that day, and without
any accident got before night to Shedemah, which I found
to be engaged in quarrel with Abdah, a neighbouring
parish, and here I am obliged, on account of those civil
dissensions, to lie by for sixteen days, and really a good
part of it in a miserable condition, being obliged, as pro-
visions were scarce, to borrow a point of the law or starve,
living altogether on raw carrots ; though indeed I had
them for the first three days with permission, but wearing
out my welcome, I was afterwards obliged to go into the
gardens at nights, and take them after a clandestine
manner.
And this should I have been obliged to have con-
tinued longer, had I not very accidentally happened to
meet a Moor who had seen me somewhere before selling
my medicines, who earnestly entreated me to go with him
to his house to see his wife, who, he said, was very much
indisposed; as indeed she really was, for at my coming I
found her to be in a high fever, being in a dry burning
heat and very restless. And now was I at a stand for some
time how to manage, for as this was what I had never
practised before in, I knew not for some time what to do
with her, especially as I had lost my lancet and burning
iron. However, I thought myself obliged to do something,
and therefore I was resolved to put her to sleep, in order

to which I desired the man to send somebody directly to
gather some poppy flowers, which being soon brought in, I
boiled a handful of them in water, strained it off, sweetened
it with honey, and gave her about half a pint of it to
drink, which threw her in a very little time into a great
sweat, and sound sleep; when her husband and I fell at a
good bowl of cuscassoe, filled our bellies, and went to sleep
also.
Early in the morning my patient and I happened to
wake much about the same time, which was indeed
very much to my satisfaction, for to be plain, I thought
she would have slept much longer. However, be that as
it will, she was revived to a very great degree, and grew
perfectly well in a few days, praying for the doctor, and
nothing she bad was too good for him. At my request she,
after giving me two gold ducats, desired her husband to
convey me safe thence to the castle of Allalben-Ham-
medush, * where I was obliged, on account of a report there
of a great party of the mountaineers having been very
troublesome a few days before at Sapbee, getting over the
walls, and killing the sentinels, &c., to remain seven days ;
during which I was, through means of some old acquaint-
ance I met with there, well taken care of, and never
failed of my belly full thrice every day; and there being a
very dangerous wood to travel through between that and
Saphee, it being the general rendezvous of a gang of merci-
less thieves, who generally stripped and murdered all that
came in their way, insomuch that it was even impracticable
for any going single, or but a few together, to escape them,
therefore when any of the people had occasion to go that
way, they gave timely notice round the neighbourhood, so
that they might muster up a party well armed. This wood
is plentifully stored with certain trees called argon, growing
* Note 36.

ADVENTURES OF THOMAS PELLOW. 279
to a very large size, and their branches spreading a vast cir-
cumference, which are full of long prickles, much in like
nature of a thorn, bearing great plenty of a fruit-if it
may be properly so called-much like a peach in shape
and smell, though none can eat of them; however, when
they are ripe and fallen off the trees, the inhabitants care-
fully gather them off the ground, and make thereof-that
is to say, of certain small stones growing in the middle,
the outer part being no other than a shell or husk—a very
good sort of oil, by grinding them small, by which means
an oil comes forth, which is used in most of their eating,
and esteemed amongst them by far preferable to that of
their olives.
And now am I about to beat up the quarters of these
desperate outlaws; for on the eighth day, very early in
the morning, I set out in company with about thirty
Moors well armed, having with them several camels
and mules laden with their merchandise, as argon oil,
Barbary skins, &c., for Saphee, passing on till we got over
the better half of this wood without anything remarkable ;
when we came up with seven Moors, viz., four men and
three women, three of the men just espiring, and the
fourth with the women, very much wounded, lying quite
naked on the ground, being, they said, thus used by a
party of the mountaineers about an hour before we came
up with them, and that on notice of our approach they in
a very great hurry left them. This put our merchants
into a great fright, and they consulted amongst themselves
for a long time if it would be best for them to proceed or
to go back again; to which I answered that as we were
got over the better half of our journey, it would be alto-
gether as great, nay, the greater hazard of the two, to go
backward than forward, for that they might depend the
villains were nearer to us than they imagined ; and should

we offer to go back it would but show our fear, and then
they would, no doubt, soon become the more bold; whereas
if we continued our march boldly on, and kept a good
look out, they would not dare to approach us, as by their
running away at our approach seemed to me to be very
plain.
On which it was agreed by all to travel on; and after
taking up the three women and the wounded man-
the other three being then dead-we proceeded, and got
without any other hindrance, about two of the clock in the
afternoon, to Saphee, where I passed for a day or two for
one of the people belonging to the caravan; and, as you
may suppose, I looked sharp out for a vessel, but could
not find any one to my mind. Not but here were two, and
one belonging to Joshua Bawden, of Flushing, my first
cousin, we being sisters' children. However, though I met
him twice, and my blood boiled in my veins at the sight
of him, yet did we not speak on either side, which was no
doubt a very great misfortune to me; for had he known
who I was, he would, I am well satisfied, have carried me
with him, and thereby have prevented me from many
troublesome and imminent dangers which happened to me
during the time that I was obliged to stay longer in
Barbary through this omission. My abode at Saphee was
no more than sixteen days, during which I often frequented
the house of Monsieur Pedro Pollee,* a French merchant,
who was extremely kind to me, and with whom I always
met with a very friendly entertainment, and I had amongst
his servants, though they were poor enough, twelve blan-
keels, over and above the master's liberality, and they
otherwise did me all the good offices in their power.
However, notwithstanding all this kind treatment, I was
more down in the mouth now than I had been from my

first setting out from Mequinez, reflecting on the many
hardships and dangers I had thitherto undergone, and still
no manner of appearance of an alteration, when who
should happen to come into my mind but the black
prophetess, whom I met with at Mequinez the day before
my setting out, and very particularly how she had told me
that I should meet with a great many difficulties before I
got off ; which, indeed, I knew so far, to my very great
discomfort, to be true, and therefore I was resolved with
patience to wait the event of what was to come. That
night, on my lying down to my rest, and reflecting on my
dreams in the cave at Santa Cruz, I was, on my falling
into a slumber, again hurried after a very surprising
manner, my black prophetess, to my seeming, taking me
by the hand, and telling me with a smiling aspect, looking
me full in the face, that I was a very faint-hearted soldier,
for that I could not thitherto charge her with anything she
had told me concerning my escape more than I had found
to be true; for notwithstanding I had thitherto suffered a
great deal, yet was I still out of the hands of the enemy.
Therefore, as she had told me before to keep a good
heart and my own secrets, so must I continue to do, and
my redemption would soon be accomplished ; and for me to
abide where I then was any longer would be altogether out
of my way, for that was not the place for me to find a ship
for my purpose, I having yet many more difficulties to
undergo. However, I should continue my resolutions, and
all would end well to my satisfaction. Then, to my
seeming, she was going off, and I, struggling to detain her
longer, started up and found all this to be no more than a
dream; and after reflecting thereon for some short time,
I fell again into a doze, and again dreamt the same, and
further that I should hasten to the Willadea, and there I
should find things more to my content. As soon as the

daylight appeared I got up to consult myself about the
journey, and in a very little time I was fully resolved
thereon. However, I considered that it might be very proper,
if I could, to procure me some company; but though I
looked out very sharp, yet could I not all that day meet
with any to my mind. However, I the next day met with
a mulatto, one of my old soldiers, and after telling him
that I was very glad to see him, I asked him what business
had called him thither; to which he answered me, “None
further than my own curiosity.” “ Then, old friend,"
said I, “ you had as well go with me to Willadea, hence
about twelve leagues.” To which he readily consented,
and as readily travelled on with me, and got that evening
into the middle of a large wood, where we found half a
dozen inhabited tents, and in one of them got our supper
and lodging.
Setting out early the next morning, we got about noon
to Willadea, off Marcegongue, the Portuguese garrison,
about fifteen leagues. Here I found two brigantines
and a sloop; and of one of the former John Simmons
of Penryn, one of my old schoolfellows, happened to be
commander ; with whom I soon renewed my acquaintance,
and found him and his people extremely civil to me. But
he being, poor man, very sick, departed this life in a few
weeks after, which was a very great disappointment to me,
and I was really very much troubled at it. Now, finding
provisions to be very dear here, through means of the
Moorish butchers and bakers imposing upon the Christia ns,
selling their beef at threepence per pound, and bread in
proportion, I, at the request of the ships' masters, went to
the markets or fairs in the province of Ducallah, about
five, or sometimes seven leagues off, and bought bullocks
and sheep according as they wanted, driving them to the
waterside, where the sailors conveyed them on board, and

neatly butchered them; and reckoning all charges, the
meat did not come to more than three farthings a pound,
a middling bullock costing in the market about thirty
shillings, and a very large sheep six. After which I lived
altogether on shipboard, and the merchants, &c., were
extremely kind to me.
One day I being on shore as a linguist, two of the
Moorish merchants came to me, viz., Elbash Mahomet
Benino, and Elhash Absolom Benino, being uncle and
nephew (the word Elbash* signifying as much as if they
had been at Mecca to visit the tomb of their prophet
Mahomet; after which Elhash is added to their former
names), desiring me to do them a favour. I told them I
would with all my heart, so far as it might be in my
power; which, indeed, as they had been before so very
kind to me, I thought I could not in gratitude refuse,
though I must confess I thought it to be something of
another nature, relating to the ships' masters, or the like;
when they, to my very great surprise, told me that I must
go to Santa Cruz with some letters; and as I had given
them my word before to serve them all in my power, I
took the letters, and after they had given me money to
defray my expense on the road, I went directly out of the
town, and as I travelled very hard, I got that evening to
Saphee, though indeed I happened to be very ill received
there, very unluckily meeting there Muley Abdallah’s
mother, and with her a strong guard, going in quest of
him, who demanded of me whence I came and whither I
was going to.
To which I answered them, that I did not know.
“Then," said they, “what business have you here?
and” (as knowing me before) “why don't you follow
your old master ?” “Follow him!” said I, “I wish

any of you would be so good to direct me how to
proceed, for I have hitherto travelled many a wearisome
and dangerous step in seeking him, and, by all I can
find, I am still as far off from my desired end as ever.”
“Why," said he," he is actually at Tessout, and thither
are we directly going to him, and you shall also go with
us, for you seem to be bound another course.” “Really,
gentlemen,” said I, “I cannot imagine what can induce
you to entertain such a notion of me, which I am well
satisfied our royal master would not, for he cannot but
remember, when he was first driven out by the Blacks, in
favour of Muley Aly, how I joined him and his small
number at Bolowan, following him and his hard fortune
to Terrident, and brought him back again to his former
right and dignity, and now you say I am about to desert
him. No, no, gentlemen, had I not a sincere regard for
him, what could have hindered my kind reception with
Mahomet Wolderriva. I hope you think me as good a
soldier as any of you, and that I dare do as much for my
Emperor; and all this, I say, he very well knows, as
having very sufficiently tried me.” “Indeed,” said one of
them, “you talk very big;” “and faith,” says another,
so he does; for my part I don't think but what he has
money about him."
On this they felt the corners of my blanket, found
all my money, and took it every penny from me, though
they did not find the letters ; and then they kept me
under a strong guard till about midnight, by which
time (they having laid out all my money in brandy)
they were drunk enough, and all snoring one against
another; when I, taking up one of their muskets, ammu-
nition, and scimitar, gave them the slip, and travelled on
all the remainder of that night (avoiding that dangerous
wood) and the next day, till I got me to the province of

285
Shademah; where, as I had no money, I made bold to
sell the musket and ammunition. And after I had refreshed
myself I travelled on, and in four days more (without
any other misfortune on the road) I got with my scimitar
to Santa Cruz, and safely delivered the letters to Absolom
Tooby, a Moorish merchant, as directed. During the two
days he was in preparing his answers, I visited my old
acquaintance, and sold the scimitar, thinking my old
knapsack and a few worthless medicines to be by far the
better arms for me; and finding there no shipping, I got
the answers to my letters, some bread, and a small matter
of money, and therewith directly went out of the town and
back for the Willadea, as fast as I could. And as it was
then full four o'clock in the afternoon, I could get no
farther that night than to the river Tammorot, where I
had the company of some travellers also resting there
with their camels, and in the morning I travelled on with
them, and kept them company as far as Hahah, where I
met with an old acquaintance, and lodged with him that
night.
Very early the next morning I set merrily forward
towards Segosule till about noon; when, having got
within half a mile of it, I saw a Moor lying quite naked
in my road, with his throat cut, breathing his last;
which soon damped my mirth, and in less than half an
hour after I met the murderers, and stood more than a
fair chance of sharing the same fate, they coming directly
upon me, stripping me quite naked, and taking from me
all but my life. This I earnestly implored them to spare,
for that I was a poor miserable wretch travelling the
country for my subsistence by way of carrying letters
from one merchant to another, and that I had no other
way whereby to get my bread, and that I should think
myself to be for ever obliged to them if they would give

me my letters back again, for that they could not be of
any service to them, but to those to whom directed, most
likely of a great deal; which, after much intreaty, they
consented to give me, together with my life, and sent me
away in a miserable condition, though indeed I expected
a great deal worse, and therefore I was very glad with the
loss of my blanket and knapsack to compound for my
life.
And now am I travelling on quite naked for the
mountain Idoworseern, which indeed was but hurrying
myself from one bad evil into a worse, for on my gaining
about two-thirds of the height, I was at once surrounded
by about six thousand horse and foot, and strictly ex-
amined what I was, whence I came, whither going, my
business, &c. I told them that I was a letter-carrier,
come from Santa Cruz, and going to the Willadea.
“Very likely," said one of them to the rest of his com.
panions, “for I see the letters in his hand.” “But,”
said another of them, “how came you to be naked ?” I
told him that I happened to meet that forenoon some
gentlemen on the road, who had taken my blanket from
me. However, they were so civil as to give me the letters
back again. “As to the letters," said he," they could be
of no service, but I think they were very great fools they
had not cut your throat, for in short, you dog, you are
a spy, and come to take notice of our strength and
actions.” “Alas, gentlemen," said I, “I am a most
unfit person for a spy, neither did I ever hear of any such
troops to be gathered hereabouts.” And therefore I humbly
entreated they would be so good as to let me go about my
business ; but instead of this they soon laid hold on my
arms and throat, and had there not been one amongst
them who knew me formerly at Mequinez, they would no
doubt have soon hauled me in piecemeals, but he, stepping
ar

forth, desired them not be in a hurry to take away my
life, for that he believed me innocent, and if they were
willing of it, he would carry me for that night to his tent,
and if in the morning they thought me worthy of death,
I should be executed in sight of the women.
Which being agreed to, he ordered me to follow him,
and conducted me safe home in a very little time,
telling me in a most friendly manner not to be afraid,
for that he would warrant to protect me from their
rage, and that after I had refreshed me by a good
supper, he would set me again at liberty. “But here,”
said he, "first take this old blanket, which is better
than none, and put it about you.” And whilst the
cuscassoe was making ready for our supper, I asked
him what those people were, and what might be their
intentions in gathering into such a body ? “Why,
really,” said he, “I am almost ashamed to tell you, and
much more that I should happen to be amongst them;
for notwithstanding they are my countrymen, yet do I
think their actions to be most unwarrantable. However,
I am constrained for the present to come into the
measures with them; not but could they be contented
to labour but a very little they might live very well on
the fruits of it, as having land sufficient to employ a far
greater number, allotted them by old Muley Smine on
his first settling them here ; and as they increased in
number, so did he also increase their territories."
“ Pray," said I,“ how long have they been here, and for
what reason were they brought.” “Why,” said he, “you
must know they were no more at first than five hundred
of both sexes, being inhabitants of the deserts, and
nearly allied to one of Muley Smine's wives (they being,
as they term themselves, a better sort of Laurbs), and
were here brought in the beginning of his reign, behaving

in his lifetime tolerably well, though soon after his death,
the breed being very much increased, they grew as re-
bellious as you please, and after Muley Abdallah's being
driven out a second time, I (to shun a greater evil) joined
them; not that I am any way related to any of them, I
being born in Mequinez, though indeed of Laurbish
parents."* But the cuscassoe being brought before us,
he left off that discourse, desiring me to fall to and feed
hearty, which indeed (my condition considered), I did,
and made a good supper in little time; when he told me
he doubted some of his neighbours would come to look
after me, and therefore he would show me out into the
mountain. And after giving me all friendly instructions,
and telling me he would answer to his comrades for my
escape, he left me to shift for myself.
I climbed up the mountain as fast as I could; how-
ever, though I was destitute of company then, I had
not gone but very little farther before I had company
enough, and, indeed, more than I desired; but on my
hearing the jackals coming yelping towards me, I
betook myself to a tree, where I had not been but
a very short time before my tree was surrounded by a
vast number of wild beasts, making a frightful noise,
and so continued till daybreak. However, as I knew
myself to be out of their reach, I thought myself far
better off than to be amongst my last night's Laurbish
gentry; and as the day came on, they got them away
to their dens, when I came down from the tree and
scrambled up the mountain as fast as I could, till I gained
the height, and quite down on the other side, without sceing
any of my last night's companions, save only two tigers,
which I passed without receiving any hurt from them.

I was as soon roused by the master of the house, asking
me who I was, whence I came, and what business I had
there. I told him from Santa Cruz, going to the Willadea,
and that I was obliged all the last night to keep myself in
a tree out of the reach of the wild beasts. “Very well,”
said he," and a good shift too." Then I told him how,
at my passing by such a place the evening before, I was
surrounded by a vast number of armed men, and that I
very narrowly escaped with my life, being really put in a
very great fright. “Oh,” said he, “if that was all, I

think you are very well off, for they are a pack of the
vilest villains in Barbary, and generally murder all they
meet with. I heard their fire yesterday-pray, was you
there then ?" I told him yes, and through what means
I got out of their hands. “Get you up out of the sun,”
said he, "and lie you down in that shed in the shade."
And when I had slept a good nap, he brought me out
some butter-milk and cuscassoe for my breakfast ; with
which, being wonderfully refreshed, I, after returning him
my most humble and hearty thanks, travelled briskly on,
and got me that night to the province of Shademab, where
at my going out I had sold my musket and ammunition,
and here I slept that night. And setting out thence early
in the morning, I happened to meet about ten of the clock
that forenoon, at the foot of the mountain Jibbil Neddeed,
or the mountain of iron, with five footpads, and from
whom, thinking to get off to a little house hard by, I ran
with all the speed I could. However, I was soon overtaken
by a very speedy messenger, being wounded by a musket-
shot in my right thigh, passing between my legs, and
grazing about half an inch within the Aesh, which
slackened my pace to that degree that they were soon up
with me, and gave me the most severe dry-beating I had
ever met with before. But on some passengers coming
by they made off as fast as they could, and I, making a
bad shift (which is better than none), got with much pain
to the house, where I got me some herbs and staunched
the blood, of which I bad really lost a great deal. Here
I got a lodging for that night, and some cuscassoe for my
supper, and, notwithstanding my wound, slept very well,
and early the next morning went limping on, and got that
day in some pain to the river Tensieft, near which stood
a castle belonging to Elelbenhamedush,* one of their great

men, and where I found residing a great many Jews, from
whom I had some remedies for my wound, and a good
supper, and very civil entertainment for the night. Early
in the morning, after getting a good breakfast and dressing
my wound, I travelled slowly on, still avoiding that
dangerous wood, and a little before night got to Saphee,
though I did not think it fit to go into the town, but
lodged in a little house without, where I got me some
cuscassoe amongst the family for my supper, and in a
very little time after I had filled my belly, I lay me down
to my rest.
But never was I more hurried by dreams as how I
should be at the Willadea, where methought I happened
to meet with a commander of a vessel, and who,
though I had never seen him before, yet did he in a
most Christianlike and courteous manner offer (without
my asking him) to carry me off with him at all hazards.
Thus, at my intervals from slumber, I could not all that
night put out of my head, but what it must be somewhat
more than imaginary, for to my mind I plainly saw him,
conversed with him, and found him in every point to be
a complete man. Then, getting up very early, I travelled
slowly on till about noon, when I met a single Moor, and
I not at all liking his countenance, as supposing him (as
indeed he really was) one of their footpads, I began to
consider with myself how to behave to him, and he seeing
me limping, gave him no doubt the greater assurance.
Therefore, coming directly to me with a pistol cocked in
his hand, and presenting it close to my breast, he in an
insolent manner demanded what I had about me. I told
him that I had nothing worth his acceptance, unless he
would be pleased to accept of my blanket. “Then, you
dog," said he, “why don't you take it off ?” “That, sir,"
said I, “is soon done," slipping it directly off my shoulderg

and in a seeming fright presenting it into his hand, and he
not being very ready to take hold on it, I threw it at once
over his head, and soon gave him to understand that I was
a true Cornishman. For notwithstanding my wound, I
clasped my right arm about his neck, stuck to him with
my lame hip, and soon had him on his back on the ground,
when I instantly decided the dispute who should have my
old blanket. In short, as he had so much mind to it, I left
it for him, taking his, and after giving him a farewell
pounce, went off with his pistol and ammunition, and got
that night into the middle of the wood, and lodged in the
same tent I formerly did at my first going that way with
the mulatto, and where I was again very kindly enter-
tained, insomuch that I thought myself obliged to make a
present to mine host of the pistol, of which he was not a
little proud, and very early in the morning provided some
cuscassoe for my breakfast.
After this I set merrily forward, and about noon got
well to the Willadea, and safely delivered my mer-
chants the answers to their letters. And before I had
the power to give them an account of my miserable
journey, I am hurried by the merchants on board a Genoese
brig, telling me that Absolom Candeele was then in the
town, and should be happen to see me, he would no
doubt carry me with him. This brig was first commanded
by Captain Wilson, an Englishman (who was about three
months before unfortunately drowned at Saphee), and then
by a Swede, his chief mate, with whom, as the brig was
there before I went to Santa Cruz with the letters, I was
before well acquainted, and with the rest of the crew; so I
went directly on board, and was very courteously received
by them, telling me that they were very glad to see me
come back well, and that they had been at a very great
loss, during my absence, for a linguist, asking me if I had

dined, and if I would eat any mullets. “Yes," said I,
“with all my heart;" when they directly ordered the cook
to fry some for me. Whilst they were frying, I asked the
mate what snow that was to windward of us; he told
me one Captain Toobin, of Dublin, who came in about four
days before, and that he had met with a great deal of
trouble by way of the Moorish merchants, on account of
his freight. “Indeed!” said I; “pray what manner of a
man is he?” “Why really,” said he, "a very jolly, well-
discoursed man, so far as I have yet seen of him." "Pray,"
said I, “is he a man of a pretty big stature ? " “ Yes,"
said he," he is a very lusty man.” “Well,” said I, “I
wish I could see him.” “Why,” said he," that you may
soon do, for he is as well as us in a very great strait for a
linguist.” When, on the cook's telling us that the fish
were ready, we went into the cabin to dinner, and before
we had finished, Captain Toobin came on board, and the
moment I saw him I was thoroughly persuaded with
myself that he was actually the same that I had so lately
seen in my dream at Saphee, and soon found him to be
under some distress ; and on his understanding me to be
an Englishman, he asked me if I would go with him on
board his ship. I told him, “Yes (if he thought I might
be of any service to him there), with all my heart;' so I
stepped into the boat along with him, and we were soon
on board, carrying me directly into his cabin, and after
drinking a cheering cup of wine, he asked me how long I
had been in Barbary. I told him, ever since the commence-
ment of the twelfth year of my age, it being then the
twenty-third year of my captivity. “Alas! poor man,”
said he, "a long captivity indeed! but could not you in all
this time find means to escape ? "
I told him I had often endeavoured it, even to the
very great hazard of my life, but I was always so

unhappy to be intercepted, telling him of my several
disappointments that way, and what difficulties and
dangers I had undergone to get thither, and that though
I hanged off and on at Santa Cruz for three or four
months, and there were during that time several English
vessels, yet could I not meet with any so Christianlike
commander as to carry me off with him. “No!” said he,
“then they were a parcel of brutish fellows; and I tell you
for your comfort, that you have met with a Christian at
last, and here's my hand” (giving it into mine) " to serve
you all in my power. Therefore don't despair, for I am fully
determined to carry you with me, even to the hazard of my
life, and be the consequence what it will." This he spoke
with so much sincerity of heart, and tender feeling of my
sad case, that he could not forbear weeping; which you may
suppose raised my joy to that degree at his so tender be-
haviour, that I could not forbear to keep him company.
Thus far is my dream come to pass, the captain telling
me further that, if I was anyways apprehensive of the least
danger of my appearing in public, he would keep me close
on board the vessel. I told him that I was at a loss in
what terms to express my gratitude; however, I did not
doubt but that time might put it in my power to make him
some recompense; but as I was then in more than ordinary
favour with the merchants, I thought there would be no
occasion for keeping myself close; however, I would be
frequently with him on board, and do him by way of
linguist all the most faithful services and good offices in
my power. For which, indeed, he had an occasion very
often after, for he had, as it were, but just mentioned his
merchant (who, he said, owed him four hundred ducats for
freight, and that he was under no little fear of losing it,
for that he did not like his frequent put-offs), but the boy
came down and told the captain he was coming on board ;

295
at which he stepped upon the deck, and received him at
the ship's side; and he, seeming to be in a great fright
and hurry, ordered me to tell the captain the following
terrifying lie, viz., that an order was just then come from
Muley Abdallah, by way of Torbo Hallusah, the governor
of Ducallab, to seize all the Christian vessels, to make
slaves of the men, and to apply all their cargoes to his
property. Therefore he should get the vessel in readiness
as soon as possibly he could, assist him in all his power in
carrying off part of the corn then on board the Genoese
brig, which was so deeply laden that she drew more
water than was on the bar to carry her over ; but by taking
out one-half of it they might both get over very well.
All this I faithfully told him in English, desiring him not
to vex himself at it, for that I believed it to be a trick, only
to hurry him away and cheat him of his freight. However,
he directly ordered all hands at work, and early the second
following morning got alongside of the brig, and that day
took in half her lading, with some more from the shore,
which belonged to other proprietors, and hauled down the
next morning so fast as we could. And as the brig was
before us, she got well over the bar and clear off, as indeed
we might also have done, had not the proprietors of the
corn stopped us and kept us there some time at an anchor;
during which there came on a violent storm, which drove
our ship, anchor and all, quite back again into her old
berth, where we were again securely moored. And then I
was soon confirmed in my opinion of the merchant's
villainy, and that he not only intended to cheat the
captain of his former freight, but to run further into his
debt, and cheat the proprietors of their corn. For we had
but just done our business in securing the vessel, before
our roguish merchant came on board, ordering me to tell
the captain that he and some more of his comrades were

going to visit the governor of Ducallah to know the truth
of this report, and that if the captain would spare him an
English pistol, he knew it would be to the governor of all
things the most acceptable present. “Therefore,” said he,
“pray ask him "'; which I did, and it was as soon granted,
and he immediately departed with it, and (as we had after
very good reason to believe) went to the governor.
But though it was only one day's journey, we never saw
nor heard of him after, no further than in a sham way; for
the second following day came the governor of Ducallah,
and with him four hundred armed men, in seeming-wise to
inquire after him, they having no doubt agreed together
before to make use of Muley Abdallah's name, the better
to carry on their so villainous designs; and lest the then
governor of Willadea might be in any wise an obstacle to
them, he sent his brother the day before to secure him,
and for male practices to bring him to Ducallah before
him. And on his carrying him thither, he met the gover-
nor, his brother, on the road, who brought him back again,
and confined him close prisoner, under pretence of his
suffering three sail of ships belonging to the Christians to
depart without his permission. He then commanded his
brother, with a few more, on board our vessel, where our
captain made him very welcome, and he supped and took
up his quarters there all night, though indeed he had his
supper brought from the shore, which was a very large bowl
of cuscassoe, with half a sheep boiled to rags on the top of it,
and the other half roasted, brought on a huge long wooden
spit on a Moor's shoulder.
Yet though they were but three that sat at supper,
yet did our captain declare that he had never seen so
much eaten at one meal before by twenty men, though,
poor man, as to his own part (as not at all liking their
foul and ravenous way of eating, he did not eat any; how-

ever, I had a good. piece of the meat and some cuscassoe
sent me out, which I and my comrades soon despatched.
As soon as the Moors had supped, I was ordered into the
cabin, and asked by the governor's brother how I came
there, and what was my business; and having an answer
ready for him at my tongue's end, I told that I had been
for some months past travelling up and down the country,
exposed to many dangers, and very great want, in seeking
Muley Abdallah, and all to no purpose ; for that before I
got thither, I could hear nothing of ķim.
However, I was then well satisfied that I might very
likely accomplish my so long frustrated desires in a
very little time, and therefore I was glad I had come
80 far; and as soon as I had gathered a little strength
after my late hardships, I was fully determined to pro-
ceed further, and I hoped to better purpose ; that the
merchants there had been very kind to me, encouraging
me all in their power, in way of a linguist, whereby I
got my subsistence, to which end I was then on board
the vessel. “Well,” said he, “our people are going to
him in a very little time with their presents, and then you
may also go with them.” “Indeed, sir,” said I, “that may
save me a great deal of trouble, for I have been almost ever
since his last absence from Mequinez roaming up and down
the country in seeking and inquiring after him, exposed to
many hazards, and all, till I came hither, to no purpose.”
At which he seemed to pity me, being with my story very
well satisfied. After he had drank about a gallon of tea,*
he laid himself down to rest for the night, and getting up
early in the morning, our people put him ashore in our
boat ; and after he had been some time with the governor,
his brother, he returned again with him to the waterside,
bringing with them two hundred armed men, peremptorily

requiring Captain Toobin and I to come directly on shore
before him.
Then I told the captain the merchant's rogueries
would soon appear, and that I knew as well as any of
them all, an English pistol to be an extraordinary present
amongst them, and therefore I thought it not amiss
to take one as a present to the governor, and if we found
him not worthy of it, we could but bring it back with us
again. “That, my friend,” said he, “is what I would do
with all my heart, was I sure I could be permitted to send
a brace of bullets out of it though his brains.” However,
he gave me one, which I conveyed close under my blanket,
and then we went directly on shore. The governor asking
which was his linguist, and his brother pointing at me, all
the mystery was directly unfolded, he ordering me to tell
the captain that he would not have him to be under the
least apprehension of danger, for that his orders from
Muley Abdallah were only to take the effects out of the
ships, and all the Christians on shore, in order to be sent
to him, and afterwards to send the ships by Moorish sailors
to Saphee, there to be ripped up.
All which I accordingly told him. “A very extraordinary
favour indeed !” said he. “Pray ask him if he has any
orders from Muley Abdallah for so doing." He told me
yes. “Then," said I, “the captain desires you will let
him see it, or at least that you will read it ;” which
indeed he did directly, and it was according to its true
interpretation in English, after the following manner :
“Alcaide Torbo Hallusah, my trusty and well-esteemed
Governor of Ducallah.
“ On the complaint of some of my loyal subjects lately
laid before me, relating to five sail of Salleeteens now
lading corn at the Willadea to be carried either to Sallee or

Mammora, for the benefit of the Black Army, my utter
enemies ; you are therefore on receiving this my peremp-
tory order, for the preventing all future abuses of that
nature, directed to take all the said vessels and cargoes
into your custody, send all the Christians to me, reserve
the several cargoes to my proper use, and send all the
ships by Moorish sailors as soon as you can to Saphee,
there to be ripped up; and for so doing, this shall be your
warrant.—Muley Abdallah Woold, the Kunnateer Binthe-
bucker" * (in English, a slave to God and son of Kunnateer
Binthebucker, who was his mother).
After this letter was read, and I had faithfully told its
contents to the captain, I told the governor that his
Majesty had not mentioned anything that these vessels were
freighted by the Salleeteens, or that they were English,
and that he very well knew that ever since the last truce,
and especially since his last exile, he and his few friends
had relief from them, and which if they had not, they
must in all likelihood have been starved long ago.
Therefore should they then go about to treat the English
after that manner, it would be a means of deterring all
others of that nation from coming thither for the future, and
which if they should do, before they had better informed
him concerning the truth of this affair, he would no doubt
be very angry with the transactors of it, and in all likeli-
hood make then answer for it with the loss of their heads.
This put the governor to a stand, and then his brother
told him he thought it very likely to be true, for that as I
had been brought up with Muley Abdallah from a child, I
therefore knew his temper, so that he would have him take
great care how he acted therein; at which he ordered the

captain to go again on board, and that he would follow in
a very little time with a few of his friends to give him a
visit.
At which I came close to him, and gave him the pistol,
telling him that the captain had ordered me to give it
him in his name, as a present; and to tell him, that he
had reserved for him on board the vessel two bottles of
superfine English powder. * "Indeed!” said he, "pray then
let him keep it from the knowledge of the friends coming
with me, or very likely they will desire to come in for their
shares ;” and just as I was stepping into the boat, to be
going off, “ Stay,” said he, “let the captain go, and you
shall follow him in a very little time, for I have ordered a
couple of sheep for him." And whilst they were bringing
to the waterside, he asked me if I knew anything of a
skin of saffron to be on board. I told him no, for that I
had never seen nor heard of any such thing. “Prithee,"
said he,“ do me the favour to inquire amongst the ship's
company, a fter the most secret manner you can, and let
me know it when I come on board.” “That, sir,” said I,
“you may depend on." And the sheep being brought by
this time to the waterside, “Here,” said he, “lay hold on
them, and carry them to the captain with my service, and
tell him that I shall be very glad if he think them worth
bis acceptance, and also that I fully intend, as I told him
just now, to come off to see him in the afternoon." And
then, as the saffron was running in my mind, I hailed the
boat, and was aboard with the sheep in a very little time,
and delivered them with my message to the captain ; and
then I told him how inquisitive the governor had been
with me, concerning some saffron he should have then on
board. “What, in the name of God,” said he," are they
about to do by me now?” “That, indeed," said I, “I
* Note 34.

801
cannot tell, but that he made such inquiry is most
certain.” At which the captain knocks in the head of a
little cagg, put something into it, headed it up again, and
put it into the bottom of the flesh cask, laying all the meat
upon it, and the pork in particular at the top. And in a
very short time the governor came on board with twelve
of his Moorish friends, the captain showing him directly
into the cabin, where I was soon called as an interpreter ;
and the first question he asked me was, if I had done as I
promised him. I told him yes, and that I could not get
intelligence of any such thing, and that he must certainly
be imposed on. “Well,” said he, " as to that, it will soon
appear;" and then he ordered me again upon deck, to
discourse his friends ; and the first question they asked me
was, if I could tell of any chests of loose clothes, or any-
thing else belonging to the merchants, to be on board. I
told them no, for that I had never heard of any such thing.
Then Captain Toobin came upon deck to acquaint them
that the governor wanted their company down to drink a
cup of tea in the cabin with him, and which, indeed, he
was drinking ; however, he ordered for those inquisitive
gentry a sufficient quantity of strong Malaga wine to be
made very hot, well sugared, and brought in a tea-kettle;
when they seemed to sip on at first, as if they did not
know what it was, but in a very little time they began to
like it, and swallowed it down as infants do their nurse's
milk; so that in an hour's time, or thereabout, they were
all of them as merry as you please. Then the governor
took his leave, taking with him his powder and his merry
companions. By the time they were got to the shore, the
tea operated into their noddles to that degree, that they
were all (the governor excepted) together by the ears, and
there was really between them a very hot combat, which
soon made bloody work, they flourishing their scimitars,

and cutting one another very severely, which the captain
and I saw from the vessel. After they had cut one another
very heartily, and very much blunted and gapped their
scimitars, they were contented on all sides to give out;
when one of them came again on board our vessel, with
two of their scimitars, staring like a wild bullock, and
reeling like a light ship in a great sea, desiring me, as well
as he could speak, to grind them for him. “ Yes, sir,"
said I, “I will with all my heart ;” and which I did to a
very good edge indeed. “But pray, sir," said I,“ how fell
you out? It is a great pity but what you had ground your
swords before you went ashore.” “What?" said he. “I
ask you, sir," said I, “ how you fell out?” “Indeed," said
he, “I cannot tell, nor, as I believe, none of us all ;” and
then he was again handed into the boat, and put on shore
with his scimitars.
In a very little time after came off the governor of
Ducallah's brother-in-law, bringing with him Sidi ben
Raudee, the new governor of Willadea, to be kept there
as a prisoner, in order to prevent his running away,
for that he had suffered the Genoese brig to sail, con-
trary to order, saying to me in the Moorish language,
“ Tollabfee haddah Corran Astah Loggadah Sbaugh ; " *
in English, “ Take care of this cuckold till to-morrow
morning.” So we put him into the ship’s hold, and
there lodged him on a piece of matting, on the corn.
And the next morning he was again ordered on shore,
aboard again at night, and the next morning on shore
again : when they finding the bait would not take, he
was again set at liberty, all this being no more than
to try Captain Toobin's fidelity; for, in short, had he
suffered him to make an escape, they would no doubt have
made a great handle of it, and it would have been very

303
much to his prejudice. However, they were disappointed
of their aim, and therefore, without forming any other
designs of that nature, they are now resolved to be more
open and bare-faced, the governor of Ducallah's brother,
and with him thirty men in two boats, coming the next
morning, requiring the captain to set his men at work
in hoisting out the corn; on which the captain ordered
me to ask him if he had any orders from the owners.
He told him no. “Then," said the captain, "I will not
give my consent to let any of it go; but if they would do
it after a forceable manner, it was what he could not help,
but as for any of his men, they should not hoist out one
grain of it, for that he very plainly perceived it was no
more than furnishing the merchants with a plausible
pretence to cheat him of his freight.” At which they
offered to use him very rudely; but he bravely stood his
ground, and told them that unless they could produce
such an order he would not meddle in it. .
On this the Moors broke open the hatches and fell to
work, and then the skin of saffron came again to be in-
quired after; and as they could not find it amongst the
corn, as they expected, they rummaged the ship very
strictly. And when they came to the flesh tub, and had
taken off the cover, and saw the pork, they fell a spauling
and spitting, shrinking up their faces, and swearing that
there was nothing in that tub but a salted devil, and ran
from it as if the devil had been in it indeed : and notwith-
standing they could not find the saffron, they found the
corn, and carried it all off that day, without leaving us any
for the ship’s use.
Now have we an empty ship, no merchant to talk with,
and therefore no further business for me by way of in-
terpreter; so that I thought myself obliged to act very
cautiously, and to expose myself to the view of the Moors

as seldom as possible; though, at the request of the
captain, I went to the governor of Ducallah, to tell him
that all the ship's corn was taken out and carried away
by his brother, without paying one penny freight; and
then I told him also that the captain and his people were
under very great distress for provision, having nothing on
board but a tub of pork, which was so very fat that they
could not eat it without bread. “Why," said he,“ do
you eat pork ?" "I eat it,” said I, “fah !” shrinking
up my face; “however, if I did, I should not eat very
much of theirs, they having very little further business
for me. But really, sir,” said I," they are under very great
distress, and if you do not send them some relief very
speedily, they must starve, of course, for they have no
money nor credit ; insomuch, that I am very apprehensive
of losing my little brokerage.”
On which he sent the captain aboard two bags of
wheat, containing about a quarter or eight bushels,
and the next day four bags more, and one bag of beans,
which was all we could get from him. And our captain
having, on their taking out the corn, sent a letter
by a Moor to Monsieur Pedro Pollee, at Saphee, to
acquaint him of this hard usage, and to desire his answer
how to behave under it, and Muley Abdallah's mother
being then there, he directly applied to her. Then in
consideration of a sum of money given her, he obtained
her order to the governor of Ducallah, that on the ships'
masters sending each of them a man to Saphee as
hostages, for the better security of each of them paying
her forty ducats, to let the ships go, and to hasten with
them thither as fast as they could, where they should be
new freighted; which was to the captain of a Genoese
tartan * then there, as he had freight in before for another

port, very heavy news. For that he could not by any means
stop at Saphee, neither should he be able to produce
the forty ducats, and therefore he earnestly desired that
Captain Toobin would pay it for him, which he would
repay him at Sallee, whither he said he was obliged to go,
and for which he would then give him his promissory
obligations; which was complied with, the obligation
given, and one of our people sent away by land, but none
from the Genoese. But on my telling the governor what
he had done, and that Captain Toobin had given his
honour to pay forty ducats for him, to which end he had
sent one of his people as a pledge before him, the tartan
was permitted to sail with us. And I going privately
aboard in the night, we set sail together, the Genoese for
Sallee, and us for Saphee, where we found our hostage.
During the time of our stay there I was kept close aboard ;
however, I had a faithful account every night of what was
acting on shore, as how we were about to take in a new
freight for Sallee; how that our man was, on Captain
Toobin's paying the money for him and the Genoese, again
at liberty; and then our cargo was sent off, such as several
bales of Barbary skins, saltpetre, and in skins a good
quantity of Argon oil.
One evening our captain came on board and took me
into his cabin with him, telling me, poor man, in a very
troubled manner, though I dare say with a great deal of
sincerity, that Monsieur Pedro Pollee had told him that
I was actually on board of his ship. “Therefore, for
God's sake, Tom, take care that you don't let any of the
Moors see your face, for I told him you were not with me,
and that I wondered how any one could invent so base
a lie; that indeed you was with me in the Willadea, and
general on board my ship as a linguist. “Then, captain,'
said he, there lies the mistake;' so that I hope he is

again by this time out of mind of it. However, I say, be
sure to keep yourself close, and I hope to be going hence
in a very little time."
The next morning after this discourse, came into the
road a Dutch frigate of twenty guns, who dropped her
anchor, hoisted Dutch colours, and a flag of truce, and
fired a gun with a signal for a boat to come off. However,
as none of the Moors would venture to trust him, Captain
Toobin went off, and found the commander to be one of
his old very intimate acquaintance, and brought ashore his
letters to Elbash Mahomet Wadnoonee,* the governor
of Saphee, relating to the releasement of some Dutch
prisoners lately taken out of another Dutch ship. To
which the captain was answered that they were then up
in the mountains with Muley Abdallah, and that they
knew not how to get at them. On which the Dutch skipper,
seeing he could not get any better satisfaction, sailed with
us the third following day, him to Markadore,t on the
wreck of a Portuguese ship, bound home from the Brazils,
taken by the Argaireens, I and by them cast away a little
to the northward of that port, and we for Sallee; where
we beat up in thirteen days, and came to an anchor in the
road, with thirteen Moorish passengers and three Jews on
board, being most of them concerned in the cargo, with
whom I soon got a very intimate acquaintance, telling
them that Captain Toobin had, through very much
entreaty, on account of my promising him to be his
linguist, been so very good as to give me my passage with
them; and then they desired me to be a faithful linguist
for them also. I told them I would with all my heart, if
my business would permit me to remain at Sallee so long,
insomuch that I really believe they took me for their friend

in good earnest, and that they were not in the least
apprehensive of my intentions.
Here we found the Genoese tartan; and Captain
Toobin desired me to step into our boat and go aboard
her with his service to the captain, and to desire him to
come with me on board his snow, for that as his people
were then very busy in taking out the cargo, he could not
by any means come to him, and to tell him he had
completed his affair with the governor at Saphee, for
which he had brought with him proper vouchers. But he
being then on shore at Sallee, I could not speak with him.
However, his mate told me that he had met with a great
deal of trouble with his merchants on account of his
freight, and that he was very likely to meet with a great
deal more: “therefore," said he, “tell your captain to take
a great deal of care how he behaves with his, for should
they once get him over the bar, they will no doubt use him
after the like manner." All which I faithfully carried back;
and then Captain Toobin sent a letter by one of his
passengers going ashore to an Irish merchant, residing at
Sallee, with the Genoese's promissory obligation and the
governor of Saphee's vouchers enclosed, to demand of
Captain Baptista, the commander of the Genoese tartan,
on his sight thereof, forty ducats to his proper use and
account; and on his payment thereof, to give him up his
obligation; and also another letter enclosed to Baptista
for his so doing. And though he, on his receiving this
order in the morning, acknowledged the debt and promised
to pay the money, yet did he in the afternoon again deny
it; upon which he was secured under safe custody, and
not permitted to go on board ; and then he confessed the
debt again, and that he would go directly on board and
deliver to the value thereof in goods as a pledge, till such
time as he got to Gibraltar, and then he would again

redeem it. To which the captain's friend answered him,
that as he had behaved so very much like a knave, he
would not suffer him to stir thence, till such time as he
had paidthe money.
But Baptista finding means to escape, got off to a
Moorish justice, swore the debt quite off, and had a pass
from him to go aboard his own vessel, which he forth with
did, and directly weighed his anchors, and set sail as fast
as he could. All which Captain Toobin seeing, and he
having an account from his friend how much like a villain
he had behaved, desired me to go aboard him, and once more
to demand the money of him; and in case he still persisted
in not paying it, to cut off his boat, and bring her to him.
On which, I taking with me seven other hands, eight
muskets, and as many scimitars, went in our boat to
the vessel's side, and delivered my message. To which
Baptista answered, that the money was safe; which
was all I could get from him. Then I ordered one of
our hands to step into his boat, cut her off with his
scimitar, and let her fall astern; on which, several
Argaireen merchants being then on board, they having
chiefly freighted her, stood up together with the Genoese
sailors, the former with stones, and the latter with mus-
kets in their hands, highly threatening us that in case
we did not bring the boat on board again directly, they
would knock us all on the head; at which we also stood up
with our muskets ready at our shoulders, presenting the
muzzles directly at them; at sight of which they all fell
flat on their bellies upon the deck, and notwithstanding
they were more than double our number, and in close
quarters, yet did we, notwithstanding, bring the boat quite
off, without any of them daring so much as to fire one shot
at us; but we safely brought her to Captain Toobin's snow.*

It coming towards the evening, and some odd things
being still on board, I, as a blind, stepped into a boat
which was alongside, wherein were several of the Moorish
merchants, just putting off for the shore, in seeming-
wise to go with them; and when the merchants asked
me where I was going to, I told them first for Sallee,
and if I could not there better myself, anywhere else in the
country, where I thought I might. “Why," said one of
them, “I hope you will not leave us, till such time as we
have taken out the small matters we have still remaining
on board of the cargo, and if you will remain aboard the
ship for the night, you shall be well rewarded for your
trouble.” “Why,” said I, “I thought the cargo had been
all out.” “No," said he, “and our nephews and two Jews
are still on board ; and you will oblige us, if you will keep
them company:” “Very well, gentlemen,” said I; “ if you
think I may be there of any further service to you, I will
go aboard again, and remain with them there for the night
with all my heart.”
So I stepped with a great deal of pleasure into the
ship again, at which the nephews, who were by their
uncle's orders to remain there for the night with me,
seemed to be very glad. Soon after the Moorish boat
was gone with the merchants, the captain tipped me
the wink to follow him into the cabin ; and after he had
shut the door close upon us, he began to discourse me after
the following manner. “Now, Tom," said he," you and I
must seriously consult together, how I ought to act in this
troublesome affair ; for these Moorish merchants are, as
sure as death, about to play the old one's game with me,
and cheat me of my freight; for on my demanding it
according to the contents of my charter part, which actually
runs, and plainly specifies, that my freight should be every
penny paid down at the mast, before they took out any of

the cargo. For as I had been so sadly bit by the former
villains, I thought it very natural for a burnt child to
dread the fire, and therefore I would not before they had
thus covenanted take it in; though I now plainly see, to
my very great dissatisfaction, it had been all as well left
alone; for to be plain with you, I know not whether their
honour or bonds are the best, they being both, with men of
their principle, where no justice is to be had, very paltry,
and not worth one of their blankets. Therefore, happy are
they who are got quite out of their country, and out of
their hands. This, Tom, you may plainly see, as well as
myself, and on my refusing to let any of the cargo go,
before they had performed their covenant. You also saw
how they broke open my hatches, went into the hold, and
carried off almost all of it by force.”
“Why, sir,” said I, “ don't you remember that on
their taking out the skins of oil, one of them proving
faulty, had leaked most of it out?" "Yes," said he ;
“what of that, pray?” “Why, sir,” said I, “one of
the Moors told another that it must be your fault,
and that you should answer for it. To which the other
replied, that when they had taken out all the cargo,
the captain would no doubt be glad to come ashore
for his freight, and then they would manage him well
enough.” “Indeed,” said he, “that, Tom, is just as I
expected ; though, between you and I, it is, I hope, what
will never be in their power; not but I am thoroughly
persuaded with myself, should they once but get me into
their clutches, they would make slaves of us all, and seize
my vessel, and all I have in it, to their own vile uses ;
which, if I can avoid, shall never be in their power. There-
fore Tom, what do you think of our putting too all for all,
and going to sea this very night!” “ Indeed sir," said I,
" if you stay here but a very little longer, it will be entirely

out of your power.” “And will you stand by me ?" said
be. “Yes, sir,” said I, “to the last drop of my blood."
“Then,” said he," what shall we do with the five Moors
and the two Jews, a married woman of about twenty-one
years of age, and a young man of about seventeen ?" "As
to that, sir," said I, “I would not have you to be under
any the least concern: for I will engage only by myself to
secure them, so as you and your people shall have no more
to do than to weigh the anchors, trim the sails, and manage
the ship.".
“Well then, Tom," said he, “I will also first consult
my men;" and after telling them the danger that he
thought himself and all of them in, he proposed his in-
tentions to them, which they very well approved of, and
as readily came into, and fell to consulting the means
without any loss of time, and it was by all agreed on to
weigh our anchors at high water, and push our fortunes.
As we knew the tide would suit our purpose about ten at
night, we got our supper over in season, and every one,
except the watch for the night, seemingly to their rest,
lodging the five Moors, for our better securing them, in the
hold, and the two Jews in the steerage. And when our
appointed time was come, and our men all ready to weigh
the anchors, and trim the sails, Captain Toobin went to
the helm, and I to my post at the hatchway, armed with
a scimitar and two pair of pistols ; and hauling in the
cables, though with as little noise as possible, the Moors
were in a very great hurry, calling aloud to know what we
were doing. “ Doing,” said I, “ about to new moor the
vessel.” “New moor her,” said they, “what occasion of
that, when she was in a very good berth before ? Therefore
we rather think you are about to run away with her, and to
carry us with you,” endeavouring to get themselves upon
deck, when I told them to sing small, and that if any of

them all offered the least resistance, or presumed to stir
from the place he was then in, or to make the least noise,
I would directly shoot him.
“ Therefore," said I, “take hold of the cable's end,
and handsomely coil it away ;” and which I compelled
them to do, though no doubt sore against their incli-
nations, telling them that they should not be under the
least concern or fear of danger, for that if they proved
conformable to what they were commanded, I would dare
engage to answer for their lives with my own. “But
where,” said they," do you intend to carry us?”
“Nay, as to that,” said I, “I cannot as yet tell ; but be
that as it will, do you behave civilly and as contentedly as
you can, and I will bring you everything you want : for in
short there is no harm intended against you." And then I
bolted the hatches upon them, and left them for a little
while to condole with each other's misfortune; when we all
took a cheering tiff to our voyage, and proceeding, pacified
the Jews (who also by that time knew their misfortune) as
well as we could.

an anchor off Mamora,* in five fathoms water, where we
were obliged to remain all that day, and till two o'clock
the next morning, still in expectation of some boats from
the shore, and which really caused some uneasiness amongst
us, though during this we were not idle, for we got our
arms upon deck, in all twenty-four muskets besides pistols
and scimitars, and put them in complete order, putting

into every one of them a new flint, and charging it with
three musket-shot, keeping them ready on the deck in case
of any visitors coming aboard to salute them, for in short
rather than to be carried back again, we were all thoroughly
resolved to fight it out to the last man; but none of them
coming, they saved us that trouble, and we were through
that means, I think, by far the better off. About two in the
morning, as I said, a fine breeze of wind coming off shore,
we weighed our anchor, and before suprising were carried
to seaward about five leagues ; and then we did not much
fear any of their boats coming after us, and row-galleys we
knew they had none ready.
Now are we, notwithstanding so very little wind, in much
better temper than before, when Madam Luna—which was
the name of the woman-desired me to tell her where we
designed to carry her, and what we intended to do by her,
and if it was not then too late to set her on shore on the
Barbary coast. I told her yes, and that in case it was not,
yet would it be altogether inconsistent with our own safety,
and therefore she could not in reason expect any such
thing; "however, to satisfy you of our intentions, we are
bound for Gibraltar, where you will be better off than to go
back again to Barbary; for as you so very much deserve
your name, you will no doubt be there very well cared for."
“Alas !” said she,“ had but I my little son with me (whom
she sent ashore at Sallee) I should not so much mind it !”
“Why really, madam,” said I, "since things have so fallen
out, I think it would be acting the prudent part in you, to
forget him for a short time as much as you can, and to
consider that as he is among his friends he will be well
cared for, and very likely be better off than to be here. And
as to your own part, you need not fear of being as well
used where you are, your beauty being a very sufficient
protection.” “But cannot you really,” said she, "put me

ADVENTURES OF THOMAS PELLOW. 315
on .shore to Barbary.” “Indeed, madam,” said I, “it
cannot be done; and if you will be pleased to step upon
the deck, you will soon be convinced of the truth of it.”
Then she gave me her hand, and I lifted her up, and after
she had taken a full prospect of the distance of the land,
she seemed to be much better tempered.
Now are we sailing slowly on with very little wind till
the beginning of the eleventh day, when we were got off
of Cape Spartell ; on sight of which, it being an old
custom for those who had never before passed through
the Straits Mouth to pay for the benefit of those who
had, a bottle of brandy and a pound of sugar, or half a
crown in money in lieu thereof,* we held a consultation
thereon, and found all saving the two Jews to have done
it before, and being resolved not to pass this custom by,
the male Jew was required to pay it. “Pay it !” said
he; “ how can that be when I have no money? You
should have told me this at Sallee, and then I would have
taken care to have been better provided.” “Indeed,"
said the sailors," you are a very cunning fellow, and
therefore answer us, will you pay it or will you not, or
will the captain and Madam Luna, or either of them, pass
their word for you ?” which, by way of making more
diversion, they seemed both to be very backward to do.
It was therefore agreed on all hands for him to undergo
the usual discipline, which was, in case of refusal, to be
hoisted up to the main-yard-arm, then to be let run amain
into the sea, then hoisted up again, and repeated a third
time; and then to have his face well daubed over with
lampblack and tallow : in order to which a rope was tied
about his waist, and the tackle hooked to it, which made
him to look after a very piteous manner, as being no
doubt sadly afraid he should be disciplined in good earnest.
* Note 41.

ADVENTURES OF THOMAS PELLOW.
And being hoisted up about half way, the captain was 80
good as to pass his word for him; upon which he was
let down again, though this did not very much please
Madam Luna, she seeming to blame the captain very
much for it. As to her own particular part, her bright
beauty was to all of us a very sufficient cordial, and there-
fore it was by all allowed for her to go scot free.
This pastime being at an end, and passing most of that
night in merry talk about, we about ten o'clock the next
forenoon, being the 21st day of July, 1738, arrived safe in
Gibraltar Bay, where my deliverer (for so must I now
call him) and his people bid me very heartily, and I dare
say most sincerely, welcome, when I fell to my knees,
offering up my most hearty thanks to Almighty God for
my so wonderful and miraculous deliverance and the
sight once more of Christian land; being really as it
were at a stand with myself if it were more than an
imaginary dreaming in my cave at Santa Cruz, and I
had really a debate with myself if I was well awake.
However, I was soon confirmed in its reality, and that I
was actually in sight of Gibraltar, and soon about to set
my foot on shore in that garrison, where my deliverer, in
order to prepare my way, went directly on shore, and
after he had answered to the governor concerning his own
affairs, he told him that he had a poor Christian slave
aboard his vessel that was taken by the infidels and
carried into Barbary in the twelfth year of his age,
which was then more than twenty-two years ago; that I
had undergone a great deal of hardship, and that had he
not very accidentally and most opportunely happened to
meet me there, he should not in all likelihood have been
permitted to come from thence himself, so that our meet-
ing on both sides was very extraordinarily providential.
Then the governor (as my deliverer told me) ordered

317
him to bring me ashore ; however, as he lodged ashore
that night, I knew nothing of it till the next morn-
ing. About two hours after we were at an anchor, came
alongside of our vessel an English sailor with whom I
happened about a few months before to have some small
acquaintance at Santa Cruz; and on his seeing me on
the deck he came on board to bid me welcome to
Gibraltar; when I asked him if he could not give me
an account of the ships then there, and if he knew if any
of them belonged to Falmouth. He told me yes, there
was one Captain Pye, but that be was bound for Ham.
burgh, and whether he intended to call at Falmouth in
his way or not he could not tell. So that for my better
satisfaction I desired some of our people to go aboard his
vessel ; but he being ashore at Gibraltar, I could not
hear any further of him that night.
Early the next morning (being Sunday) our mate went
ashore, and after he had spoken with my deliverer, came
directly off to fetch me; and after securing the Moors in
the hold, and taking my leave of Madam Luna, I stepped
into the boat with him. Here it is impossible for me (or
at least for anybody but myself) to describe the excessive
joy I felt during all the time of our rowing to the shore,
though all may suppose it, after my so long and grievous
servitude amongst the Barbarians, to be more than ordinary.
And now are we come to the landing-place at the Water
Port, where, offering to land, I was denied by the sentinels,
telling me that till they had orders for my so doing, they
would not suffer any Moor to land. “Moor,” said I;
“ you are very much mistaken in that, for I am as good
a Christian, though I am dressed in the Moorish garb, as
any of you all. Therefore, pray,” said I, “suffer me
once more to set my foot on Christian land.” “Indeed,"
said they, " we cannot, if you was our brother."


## p. 318 (#348) ############################################

818 ADVENTURES OF THOMAS PELLOW.
Then one of our people (for whom my deliverer had taken
a license the day before, and as no doubt he had done for
all the rest, and amongst whom I was most likely also
included) got out of the boat, ran to the office, and was
soon back again with a note for the sergeant of the guard,
on which I was directly permitted to land; when I fell
on my knees, and after the best and sincerest manner I
could, offered up my most humble and hearty thanks to
God for my deliverance and happy landing; being now
thoroughly convinced that I was at last delivered out of
the hands of the infidels, though I very soon after most
unexpectedly met with some small discontent through
their means, though which, as it happened, did not prove
of any great signification, as you will by and by hear.
Now is the sergeant of the guard very inquisitive with
me concerning my misfortunes; and when I had given
him a short account of them, and he had returned his
hearty congratulations for my deliverance, I passed
through three other sentries and got into the garrison ;
and going directly with one of our people to my de-
liverer's lodgings (where I found him washing his face
and hands), he took me directly in his arms, embracing
me, and with a very hearty, and I dare say sincere, kiss
bid me welcome to Gibraltar. “But, Tom," said he,
“you were yesterday, on my coming ashore, demanded of
the governor as one of the Bashaw of Tangier's subjects."
"Indeed, sir,” said I; “by whom, pray ?” “Why,"
said he, “by one Abramico, a Jew, his linguist; but don't
you trouble yourself about it, for I dare engage to send
you safe home to England, in spite of all the Jews in
Barbary.” “Indeed, my deliverer,” said I, “you sur-
prise me, for you may suppose I could not in the least
imagine any such thing.” “Foh,” said he, “never mind
it, for as you are a subject to the King of Great Britain,


## p. 319 (#349) ############################################

ADVENTURES OF THOMAS PELLOW. 819
I am very well assured the governor will not suffer you
to go with him.” “But pray, sir," said I, “ does the
governor know anything of it as yet?” “Yes," said
he, “and when the Jew demanded you of him as one of
the Bashaw's subjects, I heard him give him for answer
that he could not imagine how that could be, asking the
Jew what countryman you were. "What countryman?'
said the Jew; 'an Englishman.' 'An Englishman!'
said the governor, "and & subject to the Bashaw of
Tangier ! Pray, how can that be? I tell you he is a
subject to the King of Great Britain, my royal master,
and thither will I send him.' And so far, Tom, is actually
true, therefore don't you trouble yourself in the least
about it; for, in short, you have already got so tender a
regard amongst the inhabitants here, on account of all
your sufferings hitherto, without their hearing anything
from your own mouth by way of confirmation, that you
need not doubt of their most Christianlike assistance."
And then Mr. Cunningham, the minister, came in, and
with him several of the head officers of the garrison,
with whom my deliverer was before very well acquainted.
There being amongst them one Mr. Beaver, a gentleman
belonging to the virtualling-office, he asked me how long
I had been in Barbary, with whom and when taken, and
if I did not know Tom Osborne, of Fowey, there. I told
him I had been there almost twenty-three years, that I
was taken with John Pellow, my uncle, in the second year
of the reign of King George the First, and that we found
Tom Osborne at Mequinez, he being taken some short
time before us, with Captain Richard Sampson,* of Fowey.
To which Mr. Beaver answered, that all I had said was
undoubtedly true, for that he knew Tom Osborne very

well, and that he had heard him, several times after his
releasement and return, to talk about me. On which the
minister and he gave me their words to stand my friends ;
and which, indeed, they did after the most Christianlike
manner, advising me to present a petition to General
Sabine,* the governor, which the minister readily offered
me his service to present, and which my deliverer got
directly drawn, and was by the parson accordingly de-
livered. From the governor he brought me back two gold
ducats as his charity. Then I went to church and returned
thanks to Almighty God before the congregation for my
deliverance, and received the charity of several of them.
After which there was a general contribution; though I
did not stay there so long as to receive the whole of it, as
I shall mention hereafter.
The charity of these Christianlike people extended
even to the highest degree ; for on my proposal of going
thence in a small vessel for Falmouth, they would not by
any means suffer it, but that I should wait for the oppor-
tunity of a ship of force bound home, or of a man-of-war
for Lisbon, whither they would send me well recommended
to the British Envoy, in order to my being by him sent
home to Falmouth in one of the packet boats; which,
though I waited there twenty odd days, did not happen.
The day after my landing Captain Pye came ashore,
with whom I had the pleasure of conversing for some short
time, as also with the boat's crew, and they were all of
them very civil to me; but as his vessel was of no force,
and my benefactors had before absolutely determined that
I should go in none but such as was, I did not urge it to
him. However, I humbly entreated that he or some other
of his people would, in case they touched at Falmouth,
inform my friends of my happy deliverance and escape
* Note 42.

ADVENTURES OF THOMAS PELLOW. 321
thither out of the hands of the infidels, and that I be-
lieved I should be sent home by way of Lisbon, so that
they might expect me in one of the packet boats ; which I
found, at my coming home, they were so very good to
remember. However, lest they might not touch at
Falmouth, my good friend Mr. Beaver was so kind to
write a very tender letter to his friend at Looe, in
Cornwall, to the same purport, and which was conveyed
by his friend to my friends in Penryn.
During my stay at Gibraltar I saw Mr. Abramico, the
Jew, generally every day, and whom I found had more
than an ordinary notion with himself of carrying me back
with him to Barbary, often threatening me behind my
back, as I had heard by several people, with the most
cruel death; whereat I was so exasperated that I really
shunned him all I could, lest I should let loose my rage
upon him and happen to do him some bodily mischief,
and thereby bring myself to further trouble—not that I
was, as he no doubt believed, under the least fear of him,
but really on account of my letting loose my rage upon
him. However, what could I do when I had every day
so many repeated accounts, by way of my friends, of his
insolence ? Insomuch that I thought I could never forgive
myself if I did not give him some gentle correction ;
which, on my discoursing one of my very good friends
immediately after, I was more absolutely determined in,
he being come but that very minute from the Jew, who,
he said, had been confirming his former sentence on me;
and I very soon after meeting him in the street, the first
salutation I gave him was a hearty box on the ear,
seconded by a Cornish tip, which brought him head-
foremost to the ground, and beat it against the stones very
severely; insomuch, that had not some of my friends
persuaded me to the contrary, I should certainly have
21

done him far greater mischief: though this, I think, did
him no hurt in the main, but rather on the contrary a
great deal of good, for he really took special care to
bridle his tongue and keep himself out of my clutches
for the future as much as he could. And now was this
shrewd combat in everybody's mouth, as how I bad
corrected him very justly, and that he deserved a great
deal more.
Now are the worthy gentlemen raising contributions for
my benefit, and as the generality of the people were very
charitably disposed, there was gathered, no doubt, some
hundreds of dollars ; but before the contributions were
finished, the good ship Euphrates, Captain Peacock com-
mander, from Turkey for London, mounting twenty-six
guns, came to an anchor in the road, when my deliverer,
and some other of my friends, went at my request directly
on board, earnestly soliciting the captain in my favour for
a passage ; for that as I had undergone so long and
grievous a captivity in Barbary, and was so fortunately
escaped thither, they humbly hoped that he would not
refuse me so Christianlike a kindness as to further me
with him to my native country; or, if he should not
happen to touch at Falmouth, or any other port in the
west of England, to land me at London. Which, as my
deliverer told me, Captain Peacock readily came into, and
he as soon hastened on shore to me with the welcome
news; and doubting lest my very great enemy, Abramico,
might, by way of bribe or otherwise, induce anybody to
show me some foul play, it was agreed by my friends, and
thought highly necessary on all hands, for me to go on
board directly; and which, indeed, as agreeing so very
much with my own inclinations, after taking my leave of
my deliverer and my worthy benefactors, I forthwith did,
and was by the captain very kindly received.

On this my so sudden departure, I was obliged to leave
most of my contribution money behind me; however, I
had some, which was of very excellent service to me, by
way of providing me some few necessaries, and sea stores;
though I wished many times since, and especially on my
poor reception on our arrival at London, that I had stayed
there a little longer; which, as they were very considerable,
would have been of no small benefit to my present unhappy
circumstances. However, I am well satisfied that my
worthy benefactors at Gibraltar are gentlemen of so much
strict honour and goodness, as to remit it me on my
petitioning them thereon.
And now am I on board the Euphrates, and under sail
for my so long desired and longed-after island. But we
met with very high and contrary winds, and, according to
the season of the year, a very high and troubled sea;
though our ship being in all points well provided (lodgings
only excepted), I did not much mind it, she being so full
between decks, and close stowed with cotton, that the people
bad but just room through it to their cabins or hammocks,
which made it so very sultry hot that I could by no means
bear it. Therefore, for my better breathing I generally
took up at nights with the boat on the booms, where I lay
me down to my rest covered over with an old sail; and as
we had abundance of wet weather, scarce a night passed
without my being sufficiently wetted, and standing more
than an equal chance of my being washed overboard.
However, I bore it with Christian patience, and as this
part of my sufferings was in order to put an end to and
sum up all the rest, I was not only contented, but well
pleased therewith, rather than to suffer the smothering
between decks; for I might have lodged between decks if I
would, and therefore it was my own choice.
And now is it come to the twenty-fourth day of our

passage, when I heard called out aloud from aloft the very
much pleasing and long-expected word “Land,” and
which proved to be the western Land's End of England,
or Cape Cornwall; and the wind favouring to carry us up
the Channel, we crowded a great sail, passed by Falmouth,
and kept on all upon the same tack till we got off of the
Bill of Portland; when, on account of one of our people
falling overboard, we were obliged to bring to; and on our
throwing out some empty kegs and rails of timber, he
caught hold on one of them; then we hoisted out our
boat, and had him well on board again. After this
accident ( which, I thank God, was the first and the last
we met with during our passage from Gibraltar) we kept
on with this favourable gale to the Downs, passed through,
and cast anchor at the Nore, where Captain Peacock found
bis wife with her brother on board of a man-of-war (of
which he was commander), waiting his coming. The next
tide we got to Gravesend, and the next up the river
Thames to Deptford, where our ship was to be disburthened
of her cargo, it being the thirty-first day after our de-
parture from Gibraltar.
Here, as being altogether unacquainted at London, I
remained on board the ship seven days ; during which, on
some of the sailors publishing on shore of their bringing
me home with them, and it reaching the ears of William
Johnson's sister, she came on board to inquire after him,
asking me if I had ever seen him in Barbary. “Seen
him, madam!” said I; “yes, yes, to my sorrow ; for had
I not, it would in all likelihood have prevented me of
many years' grievous captivity.” “Lord !” said she,
“what was the matter ?" "Matter !” said I; "matter
enough, I think ; for he not only refused to embrace a
most glorious and certain means of getting off himself,
but (too much like the dog in the manger) treacherously,

and contrary to his oath, hindered those that would !”
“Why,” said she, “I hear he is very much cut in the
face.” “Yes, madam," said I," and so he is, though, I
think, not half so much as he deserved." “Pray," said
she, “tell me how it happened, and what it was for.”
And then I told her the story from the beginning to the
end, and that I was sorry I had not cut off bis head. At
which the pretty girl wept. However, to comfort her
again, I told her that her brother was soon well of the
wounds I gave him, and set at liberty through my means,
and that unless it were his own fault, she might very
likely see him home again in a very little time. At which
her countenance began to clear up, and she seemed to
behave with much better temper, though she was, no
doubt, not a little displeased with me, and ready in her
heart to revenge, as she termed it, her brother's
injuries.
Now I went ashore at Deptford, and going directly to
church, returned public thanks to God for my safe arrival
in Old England, and received the charity of the minister
and parish clerk, staying in the town eight days longer;
during which I was very civilly entertained by Mr.
William James, a Cornishman, Captain Peacock's steward;
and amongst all the vessels bound down the river, finding
none bound for Falmouth, I asked my friend, Mr. James,
what course I had best to steer. He told me my most
likely way to get a passage would be for me to go to Beels'
Wharf, a little below London Bridge on the Southwark
side of the river, and there I might very likely find one or
more of the Cornish tin vessels, or some other bound for
Plymouth. So I went directly thither, and soon found, to
my very great satisfaction, three tin vessels, and on dis-
coursing the people, I understood that the captains were
all on the other side of the water, and that I might have a

further account of them at the King's Head in Pudding
Lane, near the Monument.
Passing over London Bridge, I soon got to the house,
and luckily found one Captain Francis, of Penzance,
who was commander of one of them, named the Truro.
And after I had told him my name, he was extremely
civil 'to me, and readily offered me a passage in his
vessel with him down to Cornwall; which I most
heartily thanked him for, and with joy gladly accepted
of it, telling him I should depend thereon, and that I
· would be sure to give my attendance accordingly. But
as I found he could not sail in ten days, I, through the
advice of some of my new acquaintance, went to the Navy
Office, praying the Commissioners' kind introducing me to
his Majesty ; to which they, after they had discoursed me,
seemed to be pretty well inclined, ordering me to come to
them again, as indeed I did again and again, though all
I could get from them at the last was the very extraordinary
favour of a hammock on board of a man-of-war.
I told them that I was very much obliged to them, and if
* I could not get a livelihood through other means on terra
firma, but must be again obliged to go to sea, that a man-of-
war should be my choice of all other ships ; for as I had
never made but a piece of a voyage in a merchantman, and
that so very unfortunate, I did not care to encounter with a
second, which if I should, and again fall into the hands of
the Moors, it would soon be out of my power to encounter
with a third. Then I fully resolved with myself to give
these worthy gentlemen no further trouble, but to hasten
as fast as I could home to the place of my nativity, there
to get proper vouchers and recommendatory letters to
some worthy person, and return therewith, in order to his
introducing me and my petition.
At my going out of the office, I chanced to meet in the

street one of Elbash Abaulcodah Perez, the Morocco
ambassador's nephews,* and whom, as I had been so well
acquainted with him before in Barbary, you may suppose
I was very glad to see, even much more than ever I was to
see him in Barbary. He very earnestly entreating me to
go with him to visit his uncle and the rest of my old
acquaintance, I told him I fully intended to do it, if I had
not met him there. “However,” said I, " it may now be
so much the better for me, through means of your intro-
ducing me.” So I went directly with him, and was by tbe
old man very kindly received ; and after he had discoursed
me so far as he thought fit, as asking me how I got off,
and the like, he told me that he was very glad I was
delivered out of an unhappy country, and that he wished
himself in no happier condition than I was, charging his
people to make me very welcome, and if I was disposed to
take up with his house altogether as to my eating and
drinking, it would please bim very much ; though this I
did not care much to accept of, neither did I, after a blunt
manner, refuse it, answering him with a low bow.
And after I had dined there that day on my favourite dish,
cuscassoe, and some English dishes, I returned to my lodge
ings in Pudding Lane; where I had not been but a very little
time, before a gentleman came in, congratulating me on my
being so near to be introduced to his Majesty, and he was
soon seconded by several others. I humbly thanked them
(as supposing it only their pleasure to say so by way of
merriment), and that I wished it were true, though I very
much doubted the contrary, by reason I could get nobody to
introduce me. “No!” said they. “Why, it is actually in
the newspapers !” “Indeed!” said I. “Yes,” said they,
“it is.” On which the newspaper was directly brought
forth, and I read in it the following paragraph, viz., “A

man is now in town, lately arrived from Gibraltar, in the
Euphrates, Captain Peacock, escaping there from Barbary,
where he had been a slave twenty-five years, being taken
by the Moors in the tenth year of his age, and is to be
presented to his Majesty one day this week.” This I soon
found to be one of Mr. Newswriter's truths; for which I
told the printer that I thought him very much to blame,
for that I had given him no such licence, neither could I,
without asserting a very great falsity; and as to his
Majesty, I believed he knew nothing of the matter.—After
this I waited on the Morocco ambassador several times,
and was always by him and his people kindly received.
Now is Captain Francis ready to fall down the river.
The first tide we got to Gravesend, and the next to the
Nore, and the third over the Flats and into the Downs,
and thence with a favourable gale kept sailing till we got
off the Start, where the wind taking us right ahead, and
blowing very hard, we let go our anchor, and rid it out
there two days, when we moved thence, and got that day
off Plymouth, and the next, being Sunday, we got about
four o'clock in the afternoon safe into Falmouth Pier ;
whence being to Penryn, the place of my nativity, no
more than two miles, I got to the town in the evening.
And as my father's house was almost quite at the other
end of the town—perhaps about half a mile-- I was, before
I could reach it, more than an hour ; for notwithstanding
it was almost quite dark, I was so crowded by the in-
habitants that I could not pass through them without a
great deal of difficulty-though this, I must own, was of a
different and far more pleasing nature to me than my first
entrance into Mequinez, every one, instead of boxing me
and pulling my hair, saluting me, and after a most
courteous manner bidding me welcome home, being all
very inquisitive with me if I knew them. Which, indeed, I

did not, for I was so very young at my departure, and my
captivity and the long interval of time had made so very
great an alteration on both sides, that I did not know my
own father and mother, nor they me; and had we
happened to meet at any other place without being pre-
advised, whereby there might be an expectation or natural
instinct interposing, we should no doubt have passed
each other, unless my great beard might have induced
them to inquire further after me.
And now is the so long lost sheep again restored to his
owners, after his long straying and grievous hardships
amongst those monsters and ravenous wolves of infidelity,
and safely returned to his parents, in the town of his
nativity, being the 15th day of October, 1738, and the
twelfth year of the reign of our Sovereign Lord King
George the Second.
To look back upon and seriously to consider the years of
my captivity, is so frightful and amazing, that all must
allow that nothing but the Almighty protection of a great,
good, all-seeing, most-sufficient, and gracious God could
have carried me through it or delivered me out of it.
Therefore to Him be the glory, honour, and praise, and
may He so order my heart as always to continue a lively
remembrance thereof, and so order my ways to live up to
His Divine precepts during the remainder of this mortal
life, that after all these my sufferings ended here, I may
be crowned with a glorious immortality in the kingdom of
HEAVEN.

is built on the banks of the Guerrou, which falls from the
mountains of the Zaovias, and divides it into two parts. That
on the north side is called by the natives Sela [S’la], but by
us Sallee. It is encompassed by good walls, about six fathoms
high and two yards and a half thick, composed of clay, red
sand and lime, worked together after the manner of the
country. On the top of the walls are battlements flanked
with good towers; the other part of the town which lies on
the south side of the river is called Raval, and occupies a much
larger compass than the former. Within the circumference of
this town are abundance of gardens, and a large field, where
they might sow corn enough to serve fifteen hundred men.
Its walls are very ancient; the natives say they were built by
the first Christians who were brought out of Europe by the
generals of Jacob Almanzor, king of Arabia Felix, who con-
quered Spain. On the south-east quarter stands a high tower
called Hasans, which serves as a land-mark for ships to come
in. At the foot of this mountain are docks for building ships,
and for them to winter in. The ascent of this hill is so gentle
that a man may ride on horseback to the top.
“ Sallee has at present two castles, the old and the new.
The old one stands directly at the mouth of the river Guerrou,
next to which its walls are built on rocks, and very lofty,
sheltering the governor's house; which joins to them, from
any cannon-shot. This castle is very irregular, being built
according as the ground would permit. The walls fronting the

river are for the most part of square stones, with several towers
built by Muley Semein. Within this castle, and before its
principal gate, is a bigb fort, which commands the town.
Below, next the sea, on the point of the rock facing the bar,
is a bastion, mounted with five pieces of cannon, to secure the
vessels which come to an anchor in the road, and cover the
retreat of the Corsairs, when pursued by the Christians.
The walls next the sea are low, and very easy to be scaled,
heaps of dung and earth lying against them, almost of the same
height. It is destitute of fresh water, except what they save
in a large cistern, which receives all the rain falling on the flat
roofs of the houses. There is also a well, but water is brackish,
and serves only for the cattle. The new castle is situated on
south-west side of the town. It was built by Muley Archy,
is square, flanked with good towers, and has battlements like
the walls of the town. There is a communication from one
castle to the other by a high wall, flanked with two towers,
and built upon arches, under which the people pass when they
go to walk upon the strand. There are in this castle twelve
pieces of brass cannon. On the west side, before the breach
on the town wall, on the edge of the sea, stands another bastion
on a rock, but neglected of late, which renders the taking of
this part of Sallee very easy. The chief riches of this place
consist in its piracies, the Sallee Rovers [the Salletines, or
Slani, as they call themselves] being the most expert and daring
of any on the Barbary coast.”
This note is appended to the original edition of Pellow's work,
and is evidently an accurate description of the place when he
was so unfortunate as to visit it. The town as it at present
exists is very well described by Mr. H. C. Browne in the
English Illustrated Magazine for February, 1890, pp. 396–402.
What Pellow and earlier writers call “ Raval" or " Arraval” is
now known as Rabat, and is still the side of the river on which
the Europeans reside. M. Charant, a French merchant who lived
in Morocco only a few years after the last of the Moors were
driven out of Andalusia, confirms the belief that it was enlarged
by the latter by arrangement with their African countrymen,
who continued to inbabit Sallee in amity until in due time the
two towns were at daggers drawn. The river “ Guerrou " is
the modern Bou-ragrag. But in former times it commonly bore

that name, the Bou-ragrag of which it is now regarded as a
tributary (just as the Missouri is of the Mississippi) being then
considered the less important stream. Lorshia seems to have
been a mere country place or hamlet–or, as the word, written in
corrupt Arabic (Larsah) might signify, a garden. It is evidently
the same place by a stream called in the itinerary of the
“ Religieux de l'ordre de Notre-Dame-de-la-Mercy" (1724),
“ Larga." The forest of Sallee or Mamora is still in exist-
ence, a haunt of robbers and wild beasts—lions, it is said,
among the number—and so dangerous that travellers hesitate
to pass through it without a strong escort. When the refractory
Zemmúr tribe are visited by the Sultan's tax-gatherers, they
often retreat into its fastnesses. The river Teffilfille is of course
the Wad Tilfil, and the Darmusultan the Dar-es-Solțâna

abandoned building, erected as a shelter for travellers. But

traversed this region several times. The “Garnoe” (pp. 8, 18)

residence than Fez, and now it is in a more flourishing condition
than ever, being the metropolis of a large empire, between two
and three miles in circumference, and containing about 300,000
inhabitants, surrounded by an ordinary wall, and separated by
a road from the negro town, so called from the Emperor's
black troops (on which he principally depends) being quartered
there. To which the Bashaws and Alcaydes resort with the
tributes and presents every two or three years, according to the
Emperor's pleasure. In the middle of the city live the Jews,
having a place to themselves, the gates of which are locked at
night, which privilege they also have in most of the cities of
this Emperor's dominions. They have an alcayde to guard
their gates, and protect them against the common people, who
otherwise would plunder them; for they live in great subjection,
it being death for them to curse or lift up a hand against the
meanest Moor; so that the boys kick them about at their
pleasure, against which they have no other remedy but to run
away. They are obliged to pull off their shoes whenever they
pass by a mosque, and to wear black clothes and caps ; nor are
they allowed the use of horses."
• The city (containing about 40,000 people) is now one of the
ordinary capitals or residences of the Sultan. It is also the
treasure city of the empire, the vaults of the palace containing
considerable quantities of coin and other valuables, though by
no means so much as rumour affirms, civil war, and the ne-
cessity which the Sultan found, on fighting his way to the
throne, of purchasing the goodwill of powerful personages,
having kept the balance low. In those days Jews, in spite
of the contumely with which they were treated, played a much
more prominent part in the government of Morocco than they
do at the present day. Many of them were farmers of the
customs, Consular agents, or merchants to the Emperor, and
they were almost the only interpreters to be had, a fact which
these sharp-witted people were not slow to use to their own ad-
vantage. Some even had much influence about the palace. One
of them was this Ben Hattar, or Benatar, treasurer of the court
(p. 15), who figures prominently in the by-ways of diplomatic
history. Windus tells an amusing story of him and a rival
co-religionist.

form, or had until lately, “a most inhuman custom, viz., that
any man has the liberty of buying another and all his effects,
to do what he pleases with him, by giving a certain price to the
Emperor, or the governor of the place he lives in. Which custom
is practised all over the empire among the Moors and Jews;
whereby the enjoyment of life or fortune is not only precarious,
but a man is liable in an instant to fall into the extremest
degree of misery, at the pleasure of any one who (prompted either
by covetousness or malice) will be at the expense of buying
another, and run the risk of being reimbursed out of the effects
of the person he buys; in which case they go to the bashaw,
alcayde, or governor of a province, and bargain with him (for so
much money) to have the person they have a mind to; upon
receipt of which the bashaw will deliver the wretch into the
hands of the buyer, to do what he pleases with him. So that
the bought man is frequently tortured in the cruellest manner
to make him discover what money he has.
"One Memaran being formerly chief favourite, had the sole
command of the Jews; but seeing Ben Hattar, another Jew,
boldly push himself forward, and fearing a rival in the
Emperor's favour, he endeavoured to destroy him, and offered
the Emperor so many quintals of silver for his head. Upon
which he sent for Ben Hattar, and telling him that a sum of
money was bid for his head, he resolutely answered, that he
would give twice as much for the person's who offered it. Then
the Emperor, bringing them together, took the money from both,
and told them they were a couple of fools, and bid them be
friends. Which made Ben Hattar desire Memaran's daughter
in marriage, who being granted to him, they now between
them govern the Jews of his dominions with absolute authority.”
A similar tale, often told in Morocco, is that of the conscien-
tious Moorish gaoler who served two clients, and kept his word
with both. Among the prisoners in his custody was a
homicide, the son of a rich man, who, after the fashion of the
country, offered the gaoler a handsome bribe to permit the
murderer to escape. The bribe was duly accepted and a day
fixed for his release. Meantime he went to the son of the
murdered man, and received from him another fee for telling
him when the first incident was to come off. He then con-
ducted the prisoner outside, where he was promptly stabbed

eight thousand wives (or inmates of the harem), by whom he
had nine hundred sons and about three hundred daughters.
This prodigious number of children might pass for a fable was
there not a certain proof of it, viz., the register of a particular
tax which this province laid upon the Jews to be paid by way
of presents on the birth of every one of his children, to wit,
a pair of gold pendants, or ear-bobs, a pearl, and two thin plates
of gold, on which were engraved some wishes or prayers in
favour of the child and its mother. The value of such a present
amounted to about fifteen pounds for a son. That which they
were obliged to make on the birth of a daughter was not so
considerable, the ear-bobs being only of silver, and the two
plates of the same metal, and no pearl.” The number
of sons has by other authorities been reduced to 520, and
the ladies of the harem to four thousand, though these
estimates are little better than guesses. The palace of
Sherrers as it existed early in the eighteenth century is fully
described in Windus's “ Journey to Mequinez," pp. 100-106,
the long note appended to the original edition of Pellow's
narrative being, like most of these addenda, taken from that
volume. This building, or collection of buildings—for it con-
tained fifty palaces, each having its own baths and mosques,
and independent of the main structure-comprised a stable
or “ Aroua " capable, according to Aboulqâsem ben Ahmed

even more horrible tortures are described by many contemporary

The modern Moorish sovereigns are less addicted to cruelty, but

excluded from the good offices of the ambassador owing to his
having “turned Moor”—all renegades being recognized as
subjects of the Prince of True Believers, and therefore for their
soul's sake not permitted to return among the infidels. For he
was constantly about the Emperor's person during the stay of
the mission in Mequinez. But he “ passed it by in his journal"
because, as he told the editor of his MS., “I have matter enough
concerning my own adventures (over and above the small share
I had in that), and such I hope (being the plain and natural
truth, without the least mixture of romance or affectation) as
will in no wise be unacceptable to the reader.” The original
editor of the narrative, however, thought fit to “pad” it out
with a long extract from Windus's account of the mission,*
which we have not considered it necessary to reprint. In all, the
ambassador ransomed 296 English captives, “ being what were
left alive and had not turned Moors of those who had been
taken in about seven years' war," including twenty-five com-
manders of ships. Among the latter was Captain Henry Boyd,
who made the sketches of Alcazar, Mequinez, &c., engraved in
“ Several Voyages to Barbary" (1786).

to have been interpolated by the editor from the information

that name; they are leopards (Nemeur). Even Bruce talked
of “ tigers" in Africa. Jackals (Dib), hyænas (Debaâ), wild
cats (El Cat el berranee) and foxes (Thaleb) are, however,
sufficiently common. There is, indeed, a fox-hunting club
at Tangier, and Major Gilbard informs us that in 1853 the
Calpe Club hounds, in a meet they had on the African side
of the Strait, “had a splendid run with a wolf-forty-seven
minutes with only one check-the distance traversed being nine
miles over a very rough country.” But I do not know any
species which inhabit Barbary, and in M. Lastate's “Etude"
(Actes de la Societé Linnéenne de Bordeaux, vol. xxxix. pp. 129–
289), which gives a list of all the mammals of that region known
up to the year 1885, no wolf is mentioned.

These globes on the top of the Kutubia Mosque (three in
number, not four, their size graduating from the undermost
to the uppermost), though often an object of cupidity to kings
in want of coin, remained in situ to early in this century,
mainly owing to the difficulty which their mode of fixation
offered to the plunderer, these failures giving rise to the story
that they were protected by “djinns," "afreets" (more correctly
jinoon and afart), or spirit-guards. But they were finally
taken down, and either replaced by others, or, when their
true value was discovered, replaced by gilded facsimiles.
Another story is that their origin was due to the desire of
the Queen of Muley Abd El Mumin (1128_1162) to ornament
the mosque built by her husband, and that the gold they were
made of was derived from the jewels presented to her by the
King. Captain John Smith, visiting Morocco in 1604, saw them
on what he calls the “ Christian Church." Against “these
golden Bals of Affrica,” he tells us, “bath been shot many a
shot,” though none ever hit them. He gives their weight at
784 lbs., and repeats the tale he heard of their origin, which
was to the effect that the Prince of Morocco betrothed himself
to the “King's Daughter of Etheopea.” But he dying before
their marriage," she caused those three golden Balls to be set
up for his Monument,” while she herself remained single all her
life. Jean Mocquet, “Garde du Cabinet des Singularités du
Roi, aux Tuileries,” who reached Morocco the year after the
“ Admirall of New England," tells much the same story with
other romantic incidents. Monsieur Charant, a French mer.
chant who visited the city some time between the years 1645
and 1670, also mentions them. But by that period shots seem
to have taken effect, for these “golden apples, especially the
biggest, is banch'd in several places with the blows of musket
bullets which have been shot at it, and some places pierced
quite through them, for they are not massive, but only about
the thickness of a finger's breadth. I wondered at it, and
asked some of the ancientest men, how they came to be so:
It was answer'd that souldiers of Jacob Elmansor (1163–1184)
when they took the city did it. I reply'd why did they not
take them away? O they durst not, said one, for they are

30,000 in ordinary, and perhaps double that number when the
Emperor and his troops are there.
(12) Robbery of Officials, p. 105.-— Without any alterations
these words apply equally well to the extortions of all the
officials. They buy their offices, receiving no pay, or a merely
nominal salary; yet they usually enrich themselves by robbery
until the evil time comes when they are invited to digorge, and
unless they manage to satisfy the Sultan are thrown into a
dreadful prison, or, after drinking tea with their sovereign, die in
agony from a dose of arsenic. Poison in Morocco is a recognized
instrument of diplomacy; it is what all men dread.
(18) Lions, &c., p. 109.-Leopards are now rather scarce in
Morocco, and lions are seldom seen in the northern parts of the
empire, though they are by no means absent; yet men live for
years in the country without catching a glimpse of one. But
last century, and even at the beginning of this, they seem to
· have been common. Francis Brooks in 1681, and Thomas
Phelps in 1685, while making to the coast after their escape
from Mequinez, encountered several; and at a later date
Dominique Busnot supplies a curious account of the boldness
of these beasts, the semi-depopulation of the country during the
wars of succession, and the absence of arms and provisions,
having allowed them to multiply. The account Pellow gives
of the way the Arabs treat a lion when they meet it unarmed is
an exact description of their present modus operandi.
(14) The March to Guzlan, p. 112.- Most of the places named
in this itinerary are as yet unknown to geographers. Swagtah
is not, to my knowledge, the name of any large district in
Morocco, far less of a province, though it may be the name
applied in former times to one of the transmontane areas.
Guzlan (or Ghrazlan ?) is not a town which comes within my
ken; but there is, in the region described, a province once
known under the designation of Guezula, Gzoula, Gesula, or
Guezzoula, all of which may be corruptions of the ancient
Gaetulia. It must, however, be remembered, setting aside the

the ed accord that the
errors due to the author's failing memory, and the misappre-
hension of Arabic and Berber names, over which even the most
educated of travellers make sad blunders, many of the places
named were no more than kasbahs, or mud forts, which are apt
not only to change their names with the various commandants,
but to disappear before the wrath of the Sultan or of warlike
tribes, or to melt away under the influence of the weather
when from any reason they are deserted. It must also be
remembered that the limits of the provinces have frequently
varied according as they have been occupied by different tribes,
the whim of the Sultan, or the convenience or interests of the
hour, and that this variation of extent may have caused a
variation of name. Most of the best-known provinces were
originally, like the old provinces of France, small kingdoms
perpetually at variance among themselves, till the present
dynasty subdued and united them under one sovereign. In
Chenier's day several of these divisions bore more than one
name, and even yet it is seldom that two intelligent Moors
agree in giving the list exactly the same, while no one pretends
to define these provincial boundaries with more than approxi-
mate accuracy. Agoory, so frequently mentioned in Pellow's
narrative, though not in any previous author's, is a little town
which looks like a garden surrounded by walls. It is inhabited
by the descendants of Renegades.
(15) The Moorish Army, p. 115.- This force is now much
more efficient, being better armed and more scientifically drilled
than in Pellow's day. But its commissariat is, as of old, organ-
ized plunder of the country through which it passes. The land
is “eaten up” by it during a march, so that instead of any
district petitioning after a fashion with which we are familiar in
England for the sovereign to honour it with a visit, the people
humbly beg his Shereefian Majesty to save them from this costly
distinction, offering him in lieu of his intended purpose a sum
of money. But in one respect the soldiers with whom Thomas
Pellow marched were better situated than those who are led to
victory by the gallant Kaïd Maclean, an English officer to whom
the. Moroccan troops owe a deep debt of gratitude. For while
many of the latter are clothed, armed, and drilled something
after the Eastern fashion, they have no longer a "German" or

any other surgeon to bind these wounds. These misfortunes of
war are left to nature, or the blood is rudely staunched by native
methods, such as dipping the stump into hot pitch, after the
manner in vogue when Ambrose Paré was the most cunning
leech of his day; or, more frequently, the patient tribesmen die
untended, refusing to risk entering into Paradise maimed by the
hand of man. Yet they are eager enough to accept medical
advice and medicine from any infidel doctor, and as all Euro-
peans are supposed to belong more or less to the medical
profession, a journey into the interior of Morocco is not without
perils to the philanthrophic traveller who takes a pleasure in
dispensing pills or potions with more zeal than knowledge. The
Emperor has sometimes the services of a European physician at
his disposal, preferring such a one to his native At'oubba, and
of late years the presence of the French Military Commission
with his army has enabled him to obtain the aid of the surgeon
attached to it without the fear of being poisoned which constantly
haunts the great ones of Maghreb-al-Aksa, The German surgeon
in Pellow's force was doubtless a renegade slave. In those days
the Sultan had a free choice of almost any professional or artistic
skill from among the many captives always arriving. To them
some of the so-called triumphs of old Moorish architecture are
due. The buildings were, in reality, constructed by Christian
slaves, just as so many in Grenada and Cordova reared during
the Arab domination were the handiwork of Egyptian, Spanish,
and Jewish craftsmen in the employment of the Moorisb
monarchs.
(16) Wine Drinking, p. 119.-The ease with which Pellow
indulged in drinking bouts was due to the Jews, who to this day
make great quantities of a Malaga-like wine from the native
grapes, besides a peculiar (and particularly disagreeable) kind
by boiling down the must. They also prepare a brandy from
dates and figs and other fruits, though of late, owing to it having
been introduced into the harems, their freedom of distillation
has been somewhat curtailed. The Moors in Pellow's time
seemed to have drunk wine more freely, or at least more openly,
than now. In the coast towns a tipsy native is not an uncom-
mon sight, though his escapade usually costs him dearly if the

Arabic, being simply a corruption of Pasha, the Turkish term
applied to a high official by the Europeans-considers him worth
squeezing by means of a judicious course of imprisonment, or
of the stick. On Mogador Island there is a place of confinement
for Moors convicted of the offence, though the gossips of S'ouera
whisper that even there the obtaining of a supply of gin is
only a question of money paid to the guardian of the Retreat.
In the interior, however, it is much rarer ever to see drinking,
far less drunkenness, and at no banquet given by the great
officers of State, either to private individuals or to embassies, are
strong waters of any sort even offered. But it is affirmed that
though the Emperor is a strict observer of the law, some of his
ministers are, in the privacy of their own dining-rooms, by no
means so abstemious. Moreover, many of the more dissolute
Moors, besides smoking tobacco (which also is against the
Moorish interpretation of the Koran, and in 1887 was expressly
prohibited by Muley El Hassan, the present Sultan), are under-
stood to be quite familiar with the flavour of brandy-anything
being lawful if only it is regarded as medicine ; while one or
two-the Grand Shereef of Wazan among the number-are
rumoured to have even discovered what bit of pig was pro-
nounced accursed by the Prophet. As for the Berbers of
the Riff mountains, they drink wine and eat the wild boar
without the slightest compunction. In Muley Ismail's day
there was scarcely any concealment of the vice. The more
favoured Christian slaves, as in Algiers, were permitted not
only to distil spirit, but to make money by keeping taverns
in Fez and Mequinez, which enabled them to buy their
freedom. The renegades almost to a man indulged whenever
they had a chance, and “One Carr," a turn-coat Englishman,
who during Pellow's time had charge of the cannon foundries,
and by Captain Braithwaite's account seems to have been a bad
specimen of a bad type, not only got drunk at Mr. Russel the
English Envoy's dinner, but confessed that unless he shut him-
self up at times and took a “good dose of wine” melancholy
would have taken possession of him. The brothers of the
Bashaw of Tetuan used to enter the kitchen during Mr. Russel's
embassy, and threaten to murder the cook “if she did not give
them pudding and wine." But as one of the guards picked the
pocket of Mr. Windus as he stood beside the prince, afterwards the

Emperor Muley Abdallah, and the domestics at the palace were
so prone to cut the buttons off the ambassador's coat that he
generally appeared in his worst suit, this trait is not remarkable.

ment of those days had, either through ignorance, or through
very accurate knowledge of the Imperial tastes, sept " four cases
of Florence.” This his Shereefian Majesty, with the help of a
few boon-companions, finished in a couple of sittings, and was
so tipsy when the ambassador called upon him that all he could
say was that the Christians were to have all they wanted-
plenty of roast pig and wine. The former forbidden dainty the
Sultan also freely indulged in, though he preferred a roast fox.
Muley A’bd-el-Malik II. was assassinated in his tent by a French
Renegade named Chaban (not by “a discontented slave " as
Chenier has it) while he was sleeping off a bout of drunkenness.
Crom-el-Hajj was slain by his unwilling bride (who afterwards
married his son) on the wedding night while the king lay stupefied
by drugs she had dropped into his wine, and thus not only freed
herself from a distasteful alliance, but avenged the blood of her
family which had splashed the throne of the usurper. The
infamous Muley El Jezid was also an almost open drunkard. And
though it is not exactly history, we must all remember the case
bottles which Robinson Crusoe found on board the Sallee boat,
and the liberal use he and Xury made of their contents. To
this hour, the bacchanalian song of Muley Bou Shaïb, often sung
at feasts, celebrates the pleasures of grape juice. In short, now-

engaged as domestic servants to Europeans. As for descend-
ants of the Prophet, they fill places in every grade of society;
there are plenty of “Shereefs” begging their bread, and
are doing very well at this business, which in Morocco is an
excellent one, especially if the mendicant is of saintly character
or illustrious lineage. Taffilet being the natal land of the
Shereefs, and most of the inhabitants being descended from
them—their distinguishing mark being a green turban-the
country is known as Bled Shereef-that is, the Country of the
Princes (descended from the Prophet). The entire territory is
scattered with fortresses surrounded by walls of “ tabia”-each
containing three or four hundred families, who hold weekly
markets.
(18) Moors and Arabs, p. 120.—Here, like most of the writers
of his time, Pellow applies the term Moor in a very vague sense.
All the inhabitants of Morocco, the Jews and Europeans ex-
cepted, are often so designated. This is a mistake. The substra-
tum of the country are the Berbers, who extend all over North
Africa, under the name of Berbers, Shlubs, Kabyles, Touaregs,
&c., and though now good Moslems, have never yet acknowledged
the Arabs' domination. It is they who form the bulk of the
mountaineers who give the Sultan such ample employment for
bis Krupp guns and bis standing army. The Arabs are the latest
invaders of the country. They came when the Roman (Byzantine)
power was breaking up, and are the inhabitants of the plains,
being, unlike the Berbers (Brebbers), not denizens of villages or
much addicted to agriculture, but, for the most part, wandering
herdsmen, the Bedouins of many a familiar travel-tale. The Moors
are also Arabs, but much mixed with European and other blood.
They are for the greater part inhabitants of cities, merchants,
artizans, officials, &c., and are the most refined of the people.
Still, it is hard to draw any fast line between them and the
Arabs, though for convenience sake the term Moor is usually
-or ought be—applied to the town-dwellers of the Barbary
States.

so-called from Al Bokhari, on whose Korannic commentaries
they were sworn-deserve all the esteem in which they were
held during Pellow's time, though they are no longer the
backbone of the army, and by the formation of the “Askar”
or regular force of infantry, organized on a European
model, are, happily, incapable of playing the part of the
Turkish Janissaries or Roman Pretorians which in former
times made them so troublesome. They are, however, still
the Sultan's guard, and a fine powerful body of men.
Pellow, it seems to me, greatly magnifies the number of
the force. When they were most powerful, their headquarters
were at Mequinez, and they numbered from 13,000 to 15,000;
but they are now a much less considerable force. Originally
formed from the Sultan's hereditary slaves, brought from the
Western Soudan, their blood is now considerably mixed, but they
have lost little of the physique and courage of their race. In
all the engagements of the Spanish war of 1859-60 they
acquitted themselves like men, badly disciplined and infamously
armed as they were—and are ; and at Isly these courageous
negroes alone awaited the shock of the French. The Arabs and
Berbers made a wild charge, fired off their flint-lock muskets,
and then wheeled about, as their fashion is. But in Muley El
Hassan's opinion they were too much of the nature of a double-
edged tool, for they did not only form a bulwark to the throne,
but when things did not always go their own way were apt to
chop round and change the succession.

the interior of Morocco was hard to obtain, or being obtained, it
was hard to eliminate the lies with wbich it was so plentifully
impregnated. Yet the historians who wrote long after Pellow's
time, and were evidently unacquainted with his narrative, con-
firm much of what the Penryn mariner has penned. Many of
the places he mentions are still well known, and can be detected
under his phonetic and ofttimes blundering spellings. Others
are more problematical, especially the names of certain “pro-
vinces.” In that curious narrative of a nameless Christian
slave whose manuscript Simon Ockley, Professor of Arabic in
Cambridge, edited (1715); in Chenier's better-known“Recherches
historiques sur les Maures" (1787); in St. Olon's " Relation de
l'Empire de Maroc ” (1695); in Busnot's “Histoire du regne
de Mouley Ishmael ” (1714), and, among similar narratives of
embassies which visited the country of the aged tyrant who was
Pellow's first master, in Braithwaite's “ History of the Revolu-
tions in the Empire of Morocco" (1729), may be found ample,
almost contemporary, confirmation of many of the statements
made in the preceding pages. Muley Ismaïl delighted in war and
slaughter. He would think nothing of fracturing the limbs of
an official who had offended him, and then ordering the mangled
wretch to be sewn into a bull's hide and dragged through the
camp. If a slave did not build after his notions of what was
right, he would playfully break a brick over his head, or spear
him on the spot, or even order him to have his legs burnt off
with quicklime, and then be built up in the walls. His palace
was a hot-bed of intrigues—the rival wives struggling to advance
themselves and their sons, and to ruin the children of their
rivals. Thus Muley Mohammed, the best of the many sons of
the Emperor, by the machinations of Lala Zidan, a negro
queen, was first driven into rebellion and then butchered. When
the Emperor was intent on meting out punishment, he was pre-
ceded by a guard escorting fourteen Christian slaves carrying a
copper cauldron (captured on a Portuguese ship), a hundredweight
of tar or pitch, and as much oil and tallow, and these in their
turn were followed by a cartload of wood and six butchers,
each with a knife in his hand. To this day the hands of thieves
are cut off, and, like the heads of rebels, stuck over the gates of
the interior cities, the presence of Europeans in the coast towns

touching an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. The Editor
numbers among his travelling acquaintances throughout the
Barbary States a great many Moors who display a marked
reticence to expose their right arm; and in Mogador there is a
beggar who, having been proved guilty of slandering another
Moslem of his own profession, was adjudged by the Kadi to have
his lips rubbed with fresh capsicums! To silently draw one's
finger along his lips is still so painful a reminder of that episode
in his career, that he will instantly, in the midst of the most
profuse flattery, disappear down the nearest lane.
But in the days of Muley Ismail and his successors the
entrances to half the towns of the empire were simply festooned
by horrible human remains. He sent, for instance, after the
rebellion in the then province of Shavoia, ten thousand heads to
Fez and Morocco, to be fixed upon the walls of those cities,
among them being those of hundreds of the women and children
whom the monster had slaughtered in cold blood. He kept an
enormous number of cats—and appointed a Kaïd (Alcayde) to
control their gambols, and delighted in dog-fighting. But if the
dogs would not fight, or were so savage as to kill each other,
then the keeper was duly cudgelled by the irritable despot. Or
he would set twenty or thirty negro boys to box with each other,
the lads who came off worst being severely beaten by their
master. His chief amusement, however, was to superintend
the slaves at work, bis attendants consisting on such occasions
of a black to bear his tobacco-pipe (which had a bowl as big as
a child's head, and a reed-stem about two yards long), another
to carry his tobacco, and a third a brazen vessel of hot water to
wash his hands, and some laden with clubs to throw at his slaves
upon the top of the houses or walls. When hungry, he imme-
diately ordered a huge dish of cusscassoo, and then sitting down
on the ground, ate as much as he cared for by thrusting his
bare arm into the vessel and fishing.up what he liked best. If
tired, he simply squatted on the earth or on a heap of stones to
rest himself. His caprices were endless, though not much worse
than those of some of the later Sultans. One day he saw &
Kaïd's wife riding upon a mule ; instantly he ordered the poor
woman's husband to shoot her for daring to bestride one of
" those creatures of God which nourished and kept them alive."
Asking another officer to whom a flock of sheep belonged, he

was told that they were the property of the person addressed.
“ Yours / you dog,” was the reply, "I thought I had been the
only proprietor in the country ;” and taking his lance, this
representative of “L'etat c'est moi,” ran the presumptuous Kaïd
through the body, ordering at the same time the sheep to be
given to his negro troops. A black slave, on telling him that he
wished bread, having toiled for two days on an empty stomach,
was assured that in future he should have no further occasion
for anything to eat; and to keep his word, ordered, as a piece of
prime jocosity, the wretched negro's teeth to be pulled out.
Like the sultans generally, Ismaïl was in the habit of distribu-
ting the thinnings of his harem among his officials, a wife from
the palace being still regarded as a high honour. These ladies
are, however, apt to be what Mr. Mantilini described as “ demni-
tion savage lambs.” One of these even went so far as to pull
her husband's beard; but on the henpecked Kaid complaining,
the Emperor assured him that such a humiliation should never
occur again, for his beard should be pulled out; which it was—
on the spot.
Muley Ahmed Ed-dehebi (“ the rich man'') was a drunken
brute, as cruel as his father, but without that energy which
gave Morocco such order during his brilliant reign that a child,
it was boasted, could carry a purse from Fez to Tarudant.
One of his first acts was to order Belcaddy (Benkheddai),
who is more than once mentioned by Pellow, to be tossed
ten times, and be put in prison until he paid ten quintals of
silver; while Bengozzy, one of his own companions, was put
to death. Having gone to prayers at the palace mosque
very drunk, he fell down and polluted the sacred building
with his vomiting. The negro soldiers whose allegiance he
had bought with some of the five millions of pounds which
he found in his father's treasury, proclaimed his brother
Abd el Malik emperor, with the results described by Pellow.
The downfall of this temporary sovereign was mainly due to
his austere arrogant manner; for though sober he was not
much more amiable than his brother. But the real reason
for Muley Ahmed IV. - Deby, or properly El-dehebi, to give
him his usual name—being recalled from exile in Taffilet (or
Taffilalet), was the anger of the negro troops on hearing that
the new sovereign had declared his intention of checking their

was as capricious and as cruel as his father. But, unlike him,
was generous to excess, which fact may account for his having
been deposed six times, and reinstated as often. Yet in spite of
his many rivals, and reverses of fortune, and Thomas Pellow's
belief that in the year he escaped the end was drawing near, *
this villainous ruler, who had every vice except avarice, managed
to reign, after a fashion, from 1729 to 1757. (See also Note 25.)
(23) Pellow's journey to “ Guinea,” p. 196.—In these days
the Emperors of Morocco had regular intercourse with Tim-
buktoo, in which for a time they had a garrison, or received
tribute in lieu of the right of keeping that expressive symbol of
authority there, and, as at the present day, caravans went
regularly to the Soudan in search of slaves, gums, and other
commodities. It was with one of these that Pellow affects to
have gone, and though, owing mainly to the lack of maps
portraying the route, it is not easy to identify all of his names,
yet many of them, not known to geographers until a later
period, are not hard to make out. The term “Guinea" was
at that period applied to all the coast north of the Cape of
Good Hope and south of Morocco, so that the use of the
word must not deceive. He makes, however, no pretence
(as he could easily have done had he wished to tell a tale
of wonder) of having reached Timbuktoo, as Paul Imbert, a
French slave, did, or as Robert Adams, a sailor wrecked north
of Cape Blanco, more than a century and a half later, claimed to
have done, or to have made the Mecca pilgrimage as Joseph Pitts
of Exeter, while in Algerian slavery, actually did in the closing
years of the seventeenth century. Pellow was an uneducated
man, with little idea of the geography of the regions over which

fabricate a narrative, he would not have declared that he had
reached the “ Wad Nil, or river Nile," for even in those days
this would have at once stamped him as a liar, the Nile rising
in an entirely opposite direction. But it is now a familiar fact

that the Niger is known to the Arabs as the Wad Nil el
Abid, or Nile of the Slaves (Blacks), the word Nile being in that
region a common name for any large stream. In reality, from
the fact of the caravan having seen a French vessel in the
river, Pellow and his slave-hunting comrades seem to have
reached the Senegal, the mistaking of it for the Niger being
natural enough, as the real course of the latter was not known
until many years subsequently. Agloou," the fishing coves"
mentioned, is a poor anchorage; but the villages in the
surrounding country are prosperous and well peopled.
(24) The Desert between Morocco and “ Guinea," p. 199.- This
dreadful waste of sandy billows is described in its latest details
by Dr. Oskar Lenz, who succeeded in passing it in the year
1880 on his journey to Timbuktoo, though only a small portion
of his route lay near Pellow's. The privations endured by the
caravans are terrible. The Arabs who carry on the trade
between that city and Mogador declare that five hundred
dollars have been given for a draught of water, and that when
the water-skins have been partially dried up in the manner
described by our author, it is by no means uncommon for the
precious fluid to be held at the rate of fourteen to twenty
dollars a drink. In 1805-80 Jackson, who carried on business
at Agadir, relates—& caravan proceeding from Timbuktoo to
Taffilet was disappointed in not finding water at one of the
usual wells, when, horrible to relate, the whole of the persons
belonging to it, two thousand in number, besides eighteen
hundred camels, perished by thirst. Misfortunes of this sort
account for the vast number of human and other bones which
are found mingled together in various parts of the desert.
The traders at that period—1794-1808—told the same tale
as Pellow does of the “ Akkabaahs," or caravans, being
directed by the guides smelling the earth. Jackson, however,
with characteristic self-sufficiency, not always warranted by the
accuracy of his “facts," was of opinion that this was “an
artful invention of their own, to impose upon the credulity of
this superstitious and ignorant people, and thus to enhance
the value of their knowledge.” The desert pilots “ possess

star, they can by that unvarying guide steer their course with
considerable precision, preferring often travelling in the night
rather than under the suffocating heat of the effulgent meridian
sun." The references to mummies (p. 202) in connection with
surgeons indicate the use of them as medicine-a purpose to
which they were put in regular practice during the seventeenth
century, and among empirics to a much later date.
(25) Muley Abdallah’cruelties, p. 226.- Scarcely a week
passed, a French writer * tells us, without Abdallah putting to
death great numbers of his subjects in the most horrid manner,
some by nailing them to walls, others by being tied by the feet
to a mule's tail, and thus dragged through the streets; others
were kept incessantly employed at the most laborious work,
solely to make them as miserable as possible. He even obliged
the Christians and the Chaânba † (the latter being tribesmen
of the Atlas, of whom Crom-el-Hajj was chief, and who ever
since had been cruelly used by the Sultans) to pull down the
town of Erriâdh, which obstructed the view from his seraglio.
This place contained the residences of various functionaries of
Mequinez, during the time of Muley Ismail, who had built a
fine mosque in the centre, beside bazaars, baths, and a college.
While-demolishing this town, one of his greatest pleasures was
to order his guards to drive great numbers of the labourers
under walls which had been undermined and were just ready to
fall, that he might see them buried alive in the ruins. In short,
there was no sort of brutality in which Muley Abdallah did not
seem to take a pleasure. Neither virtue, merit, nor the strictest
ties of blood, put any restraint on his cruelty. Even his own
mother was in perpetual danger of losing her life by his hands.
One day in particular he went with a pistol to her apartment,
with a design to kill her. “But she being advised of it, went
out to meet him, and embracing him, spoke to him with so
much tenderness, the tears at the same time falling down her

cheeks, that she softened his barbarous heart, so that he seemed
seized with horror at the action he was going to commit, and
denied it in the strongest manner; however, his mother thought
it prudent to absent herself from his presence and court for a
considerable time.
Nothing could exceed his ingratitude and cruelty to the
Bashaw Hogmy, governor of Mequinez, who had been a chief
instrument in setting him on the throne, and to whom he had
sworn in his first transports, on his being proclaimed king, that
he would never make use of a lance or fusil against him ;
however, taking umbrage at the great reputation of this
Bashaw, and the esteem he was in with his people, on account
of his great merit and virtue, he ordered him one day to come
before him, and after having reproached him with accusations
which had no foundation, he ordered him to sit down and pull
off his turban. Then immediately a great number of boys,
who had been provided for the purpose, came about him, and
with pieces, of lead they had in their hands struck upon his
head till they had beaten it in pieces; and immediately after
this, both his secretary and brother were served in the same
manner.
He showed no less cruelty to eight young Alcaydes, to whose
marriage he had just given his consent. It is the custom of
those parts that the new-married couples (during the space of
seven days) take upon them amongst their kinsfolks and friends
the title of king and queen, and during this time they have a
power of putting a forfeiture on those who were present at
their wedding, and of throwing into the water, with all their
clothes on, those who refuse to pay it. But these rejoicings are
only made when the bride is found a maid ; for when it proves
otherways, the husband sends her back to her father's house,
and the father has a right to strangle her. These eight young
Alcaydes, according to custom, assumed this power during the
seven days, thinking no harm; but scarce were these days of
rejoicing over, but the tyrant sent for them, and having re-
proached them for the liberty they had taken, as a heinous
crime, he ordered them to be tied by the feet to a mule's tail,
and in that manner drawn through all the streets of Mequinez
till they were dead.

value, hearing that he was about to give liberty to eleven
Spanish slaves, fell down on his knees, and entreated him in the
tenderest and most respectful manner that he would be pleased
to let his father, who was likewise a slave, and far advanced in
years, be one of the number of those who were to be released :
to which Abdallah made no reply. The next day the slave, with
tears in his eyes, and in the most moving manner, renewed his
request; but Abdallah looking upon this so natural and praise-
worthy affection as a crime, ordered the slave to be immediately
tossed up in the air and let fall upon his head till he expired.
And as if this was rot cruel enough, and as if he had been
willing to punish the father for the tenderness of his son, he
set the poor old man to such hard labour that he died a few
days after."
His mother one day representing to him that it was contrary
to humanity to put the innocent to death and beneath his
dignity to be the executioner of them himself, he replied “ that
bis subjects had no longer a right to life than he pleased, and
that he knew no greater pleasure than that of putting them to
death with his own hands."
The man seemed really to have been more mad than sane,
and was well aware of this himself. One day he made a
favourite servant the present of two thousand ducats, and told
him to go far from his presence, so that he might not be
exposed to the effects of his fury. The attachment of the slave
to his inhuman master was, however, so great, that he refused,
and in due time fell a victim to one of the Emperor's violent
fits of fury, being reproached, when dying, with his folly in not
having left the court when advised.
On another occasion, when passing the river Beth (Bate) at
the place where it falls into the Sebou, he was in danger of
being drowned, when one of his negroes at great peril to his
own life rescued the floundering Prince of True Believers.
The slave's only reward was to be hewn down with his master's
sabre for presuming to congratulate himself on his good fortune
in being able to rescue so sacred a person. “You are an
infidel !” he cried, " to suppose that you have saved me. As
if Allah stood in need of your intervention to preserve a Shereef
and the son of a Shereef”- that is a descendant of Mohammed.

freedom from the awe with which most of his countrymen regard
the rascally “ saints " of Morocco. But his vices, most of them
of the most hideous type, have earned for Abdallah an evil
eminence in the evil dynasty of the Alides, only second to that
of Muley-el-Jezîd-or Yezeed, as the name is pronounced in
Morocco. In this volume philological purism is not attempted
in the transliteration of Arabic names, the rule adopted being
to accept the form most generally used, and therefore most in-
telligible, without much regard to its minute accuracy.

(28) The Fratricidal Wars of Muley Ismail's Sons, p. 228.-
Pellow's narrative, though it contains many minute particulars
regarding the war between Muley Abdallah and his brothers, is
simply such a story as might be picked up from the camp
rumours of an army on the march through a country where
truth is an exotic virtue, and wild exaggeration the normal
condition of affairs. Yet it is in the main correct. Muley Ali,
who was elected by the black Janissaries Emperor on the 29th
September, 1784, was another of Muley Ismail's sons. But he
was deposed in May, 1786, in favour of Abdallah restored. The
new sovereign, besides being poor (which was no recommendation
in the eyes of the negro troops), had so addicted himself to the
use of “ Achecha” (Hashesh), Bang, or Indian hemp—the Keef
of the Moors—as to render him numb alike in body and mind.

The negroes soon proving fickle, he was deposed (1740), and
retired to Azila,* where he carried on a considerable trade in

time, Mustadi pillaged the environs of Fez, and on his return was
attacked near Al K'sar by Abdallah, and forced to retreat into
Sallee, where he had been so popular as governor that he was
received and acknowledged as Emperor. But Rabat on the
other side of the river refused to bend the knee to him. The
result was a ruinous civil war between these two towns, which,
under Muley Ismail, had become a kind of republic feudatory to
the empire. For fourteen months Rabat was besieged, until
Mustadi, despairing of taking the place, retired to Tedla, where
he was arrested and put in irons by the Berbers in the interest
of Abdallah. Another faction holding the castle of Oordega,
however, released him, and transferred him to the sanctuary of
Sidi El Mati, a hereditary saint who escorted Mustadi to Sallee,
where he was again received with gladness, as the town was
thoroughly opposed to Abdallah. Finding that it was vain to
hold his own against Abdallah, he resumed his corn trade at
Azila, and there continued to reside in a private station until
the accession of Sidi Mohammed, when he was ordered to take
up his residence in Fez, where he died.

greater number of them are vile rascals, who have more trades

while the poemploy emetics when, as a la pose themselves fire in
and other diseases of the eye are still, as in Pellow's day, the
common maladies of the country, more especially in the South,
and it is not without interest to remark that one of the common
native remedies is counter-irritation produced by blowing pepper
into the eyes after the fashion which the highwayman (p. 247)
found so ineffectual. Now as then, purgative medicines are in
active demand, the well-to-do Moors gorging themselves to re-
pletion at every meal, even when, as a late Grand Vizier did,
they do not employ emetics in order to begin a feast de novo ;
while the poorer ones risk dyspepsia whenever the world smiles
brightly enough to render a gorge of cusscassoo and fat mutton
an approachable luxury. The reason why these wandering
quacks are more popular than the native doctors, is not that they
are as a rule more skilful, but simply because it is believed that
all Christians are, by the gift of God, adroit healers of sick folk.
Christ (“Sidna Aissa ") so runs the Moslem legend—was a great
physician, and his power has descended to all his followers.
“Son of Jesus," the traveller is not unfrequently told,“ thou can
relieve me." But if he succeeds, not he but Allah is thanked,
for without the inspiration and permission of God man is
powerless to accomplish anything, and therefore deserves no
credit for his acts. At the same time, a rabbit or a few partridges
may be offered as a gift, and not unlikely the doctor as he sits in
his tent door may be told—as the writer was by a poor woman
whose child he had relieved "What a pity it is that so good a
man can never enter Paradise !” This at all events, though
somewhat negative in its good wishes, is more soothing than the
not uncommon malediction of an elderly beauty whom the
infidel may happen to encounter in a narrow lane (when there
are men folk about)—"May Gehenna be your portion! The
fire is lighted for you!” The “conjurors" with whom Pellow
had such evil luck were doubtless miracle-working “ saints," or
marabouts as they are called in Algeria. The snake-charmers
and " Aissouia”-a wild religious sect who handle serpents with
seeming impunity, and indulge in a host of hideous ceremonies-
are a different class. They go annually to Soos and other
quarters to collect reptiles and scorpions. The fire-eaters and
the ordinary" Jack-Puddings" who may be seen in every market,

interesting features in any gathering in Morocco. The itinerant
doctors (or at'oubba, sing. t'bib) carry a leather bag containing,
besides a few medicines, their surgical instruments, which
usually consist of a lancet, a knife for scarifying, and a burning
iron, which is used for almost every ill that Moorish flesh is
heir to. That so few of their patients die may be attributed
to their simple life and hardy constitutions.
(31) The Geography of Pellow's flight, pp. 261–290.-Some of the
minor places mentioned in this narrative cannot now be identi-
fied. (and indeed the writer expressly mentions that they were
destroyed doing the civil and other wars), though this is chiefly
owing to the country in which they were situated being still
wholly or partially unknown to geographers. Many of these are,
however, familiar, though, at the time Pellow wrote, not on any
map, or on those to which it is extremely unlikely either he or
his editor had access, and then under names so differently spelt
from his, that this fact tells in favour of the authenticity of bis
narrative. As the interest of this work is mainly in the adven-
tures it describes, I have not thought it necessary to try and
localize all of them. But as a test of the writer's bona fides, this
may be done here and there, in addition to the names already
identified in foot notes.
The “ Waddonfeese” (p. 262) is, for instance, the Wad-Enfisa
(or ’N fis), a tributary of the Tensift. “Rosselelwad" is still the
pame of a village and district-or“ parish" as Pellow puts it-
the Ras-el-Wad in Sus (p. 265), while Tarudant (Terrident) is a
well-known town. At one time there was a considerable trade
with this place, but it is now so fanatical that no Europeans visit
it, and since the decay of Agadir it has fallen into ruins, and is
without much commerce or industry, though surrounded with
olive, orange, and date gardens. From information obtained
through the European officers of the Sultan's army, it appears that
the place is about 690 feet above the sea, and contains between
six and seven thousand inhabitants, including a considerable
number of Jews and Berbers, the latter of whom, armed to the
teeth, swagger along its narrow filthy lanes, eyeing the stranger
with a ferocious glare, and wreaking vengeance on any enemy
whom they may encounter, almost with impunity from the badly
organized police of this whilom residence of the Shereefs, and the

centre from which they carried on a religious propaganda among
the neighbouring tribes. “Arhallah " I take to be a corrup-
tion of Aouara or Haouara; and Gesseemah is most likely
Exima, a tribal (Ouled) village and “parish " in the position
assigned to it. Santa Cruz or Agadir (this name, which means
in the Berber language a protecting wall, being applied to several
other places) is a picturesque fortress perched on a spur of the
Atlas, about 990 feet above the sea. Up to the year 1760, when
Sidi Mohammed ben Abdallah founded Mogador (Note 87),
owing to the difficulty he found in exacting his dues at the Sous
port, as well as to punish the rebellious Sousees, Agadir was in
the enjoyment of considerable intercourse with Europe. But it
is now fallen entirely into decay, the fishing village of Fonti
at the base of the fortress being a miserable place, and the
inhabitants so bigoted that when, during the expedition of 1882
against Sidi Hussein of Tazelronalt, the Sousan religious chief,
the Sultan authorized grain ships to discharge here, the people
refused to sell sheep to the crews until the authorities compelled
them to "feed the infidel" in spite of the Korannic injunction to
the contrary. In 1773, Sidi Mohammed ordered all the foreign
merchants to leave, and since that date, with the exception of
a brief interval (1792–1797), it has been closed to sea-borne
commerce. “ Terroost,” or Tourazt, is not an uncommon Berber
name, though I do not identify the particular village so named.
“ Hahah" is a well-known province. Between Agadir and the
north a spur of the Atlas must be crossed, either by the Ham-
serout or the Bebaouan passes.
The method of preparing the locust (jeraad) for food (p. 276)
is that still practised. They are considered by the Moors very
stimulating food.
" Zumineeta " (Zesomeeta, or Zummeeta, as it is called in
Tripoli) is made of barley which has been a little malted,
coarsely ground, and sometimes mixed with dates, and is eaten
in the form of dough with salt, argan or olive oil, and with water
also. Barley meal and water or milk is the ordinary morning diet
of the country people, who know it as “El hassûa.” The
barley is ground to the size of fine shot, and simmered over a
.slow fire. This food is regarded as so particularly wholesome
and cooling, especially during fever time, that the Sultan him.

Oke their ter the wall, and after A wandera
lays a foundation of it before drinking the fine hyson which he
loves. Its health-giving qualities are celebrated in a little tale
told by the southern tribesmen. A wandering doctor arrived
in a strange country, and after saying the morning prayer,
inquired after the way the people lived, and with what food they
broke their fast. On being told that it was El hassûa, he rose,
saddled his mule, and bade them good-bye.“ Salaam u alikoum!
Peace be with you. For if you eat El hassûa in the morning,
you have no need of a doctor!" This meal is prefaced by a
brief grace consisting of “Bismallah” (“In the name of God”).
But every act of the Moor is flavoured with piety. Even the
street hawker is careful to preface the calling of his wares by
some preparatory objurgations to attract the faithful. “God is
gracious! Beans, fried beans !” “In the name of Muley
Idriss! Roast Chestnuts !” “ In the name of Sidna Mohammed
Al Hadjj! Popcorn!”; and I can recall among the most
agreeable of street cries, after a hot ride over the dusty plain
where Dom Sebastian met his doom, hearing in the filthy Soko
of Al K'sar El Kebir, the welcome shout, “In the name of Sidna
Ali-bou-Rhaleh! Melons, nice sweet melons!” The familiar
tale of the Stambouli who invoked custom for his figs "in the
name of the Prophet 1” which has amused Europe for a century,
scarcely tickles a resident of Morocco. For this or something
similar is what he hears every day of his life (p. 276).
“ Idogurt” is, we have already noted, Ida-ou-gort, not far from
Mogador; and Shiedmah and Abdah are still the designations
of proſinces.
The Argan tree is the source of the argan oil, so extensively
used in the cookery of Southern Morocco, though there is an
unfounded belief in some parts of the country that it engenders
leprosy (p. 279). “ Saphee" is the modern Saffi (p. 278) or
Asfi, a town which, after having been in the hands of the Portu-
guese for more than a century, was voluntarily deserted by them
in 1641. It contains a number of sanctuaries (Zaouias), the
burial-places of holy men, where criminals finds a safe refuge.
The “ Rabat” or quarter on the cliff south of the main town
is a veritable City of Refuge, so that, as in Pellow's day, it is
" the great rendezvous” of undesirable characters.
“Willadea ” (p. 282), or El Waladia, is a town 35 miles south
of Mazagan, of which we seldom hear nowadays, though in former

times it was a place of some trade. It is situated on an exten-
sive plain, and were not the entrance to its harbour obstructed
by rocks, the cove might be capable of containing a large fleet
of vessels. The town itself is small, and encompassed by a
square wall, but it contains few inhabitants, there being almost
nothing for them to do, as no Europeans live there, and no
caravans arrive as ships never come. During the usurpation
of Crom-el-Hajj (1648–1652) this place, called in a contemporary
document “Houladilla," was occupied, and employed as a base
for the siege of Saffi. “Marcegongue” (pp. 229, 282, etc.) is a
curious corruption of Mazagan, now the principal outlet for the
maize of the rich plains behind it. This town was held until
1769 by the Portuguese, who, on abandoning it, founded Villa
Nuova de Mazagan in Brazil. The “River Tammorot” (p. 285)
is clearly the Wad Tammerekt which appeared on no map for
nearly 65 years after Pellow mentioned it (I believe) for the first
time ; and not to attempt the identification of every village, the
"mountain Idoworseern” (p. 286) is probably the Djebel Ataneen,
and “Gorrasurnee” (p. 275) the Idiaugomoron, while “ Jibbil
Neddeed” (p. 290) is, of course, Djebel Hadid, the Iron Mountain,
north of Mogador. The “ high mount called Itatteb" (p. 238)
is evidently Itata, S.S.E. of Mequinez. The “ Monsieur Pedro
Pollee" who entertained Pellow (p. 280) was most likely Pierre
Pillet, a renegade who, as mentioned in our introduction, was,
under the name of Abd-el-Adi, for a short time governor of
Sallee. Espousing the cause of Abd-el-Malik, he was beheaded,
and his corpse suspended by the heels from one of the gates of
the town which he had ruled, though the date of this tragedy not
quite agreeing with Pellow's narrative, leaves us open to doubt
whether the identification suggested is correct.
(32) Mecca Pilgrims, p. 283.—“Elbash” is a fairly phonetic
form of El Hājj, or Hadjj, the courtesy title with which every
Moslem is dignified after having made the Mecca Pilgrimage.
However, in common with many of the old writers, Pellow
blunders in making Mecca the burial-place of the Prophet,
instead of Medina. It was, of course, his birthplace. All the
princes of the Imperial house are styled “Muley” (Madláž,
Mulai, Maulay, Moulé, Mole), “My lord,” or master, a fact of

(38) Tea Drinking, p. 297.—Though there is a good deal of
coffee drunk by the humbler Moors in their shabby coffee-houses,
which are not, as in Turkey and Egypt, frequented by the better
classes, the Moors of Morocco, as a people, differ from most
other Moslems in preferring tea to coffee, and green tea to any
other variety of the herb. They infuse it with large quantities
of sugar, and flavour it, in lieu of cream, with mint, citron
leaves, orange blossoms, ambergis, &c. The amount drunk
at a sitting is never less than three cups or glasses, and
as the sittings mean six times a day, and as often more as
favoured visitors call, it may well be believed that more tea per
head is consumed in Morocco than in any other part of the
world. Yet up to the year 1660, at earliest, the Moors were
perfectly ignorant of what may now be termed the national
beverage. For in a paper of that date written by Monsieur
Charant, the French merchant " who lived twenty-five years in
the kingdom of Sus and Morocco," it is expressly mentioned
that though some of the less devout do not forbear by stealth
to drink wine, nay brandy; “which both the Christian slaves and
Jews sell," such drinks as coffee, thee, and chocolate they know
not in those countrys what they are," though the writer adds
that he heard they are much used in England. Coffee in an
especial degree is there drunken in "great store” to prevent
drowsiness. “And as for thee and chocolate (some think) they
strengthen nature, revive and refresh the spirits, when weakened
by overmuch study.”.

he encountered refers, I am of opinion, to the inroad of those
Arabs which about this period added to the intestine troubles
of Morocco. They claim to be sprung from Shereefs (the
“Xeriphs" of Pellow), and are very warlike. During the civil
war following the death of Muley Ismail — not during Sidi
Mohammed's reign as Jackson declares—they left their sandy
deserts in Sous, and, to the number of about 7,000 men, overran
the southern parts of the empire, until, with little or no opposi.
tion, they reached the provinces of Abda and Shiedma, where
Pellow met them. Here they had a battle with the Woled-el-
Haje and other tribes of the fertile country north of the river
Tensift, but were so completely victorious that they almost
exterminated their enemies, and holding their ground against all
opposition, took possession of the depopulated territory. But
their predatory disposition made the country so unsafe that
Sidi Mohammed outlawed the whole clan, and ordered them to
leave the country in which they had settled. This order was
forced to be obeyed by the Sultan's army, who drove them south,
the natives of the provinces through which they had to flee
plundering and murdering so many that only about half of the
tribe reached the Sahara in an impoverished condition.
(36) Allalben-Hammedush (p. 278) or Elebenhamedush (p. 290).-
I cannot find any mention of this “castle" or Kasbah of Ali ben
Hamedûsh, as it would be called in Morocco, on any map or
document prior to Pellow's day, or since, unless the point named
“Ben Hamuda" on Gråberg di Hemsö's" chart is the same place.
Nor indeed is it mentioned by any traveller since that day, with
one exception, and this exception is a striking proof of the
general accuracy and authenticity of the Penryn mariner. For
Dr. Gerhard Rohlfs, who had no knowledge of this book, casu-
ally notes that though he was unable to find the town called
Rabat el Kus which so many geographers describe at the mouth
of the Tensift, not far from its banks “are the romantic ruins of
an old castle, called Kasbah Hammiduh, situated on some abrupt
rocks in the midst of a forest. It was probably erected to guard
the mouth of the river.” This is clearly the same place de-
scribed by Pellow, and perhaps it is also the “square castle built
in the reign of Muley Ishmael to defend the passage of the
river,” which, in Chenier's day (1767) contained only a few

families, though that usually accurate writer does not mention
the name it bore. I have not visited the place, but a correspon-
dent of whom I made inquiries writes that the “ Kasbah of Ham-
doosh” is an extensive ruin, not unlike that of Old Tangier, but
of greater extent and in better preservation. Granaries, battle-
ments, and rooms can still be traced. It was evidently intended
as a check upon the Portuguese fort at the mouth of the river,
though this also has now almost vanished. But it is incorrect to
suppose that it was built by Sidi Mohammed, as this sovereign
(the founder of Mogador) lived after Pellow's day.
(37) Markadore, p. 306.—This curiously spelt place appears to
have been Mogador, the well-known southern port of Morocco.
At that time the Portuguese monopolized most of the coast trade,
and,, as the “Portuguese fort” on the shore of Mogador Bay
shows, had fortified places on other parts of the Atlantic shore
than that which they actually held. For it is an error to believe
that the fort in question dates no further back than the begin.
ning of this century, or was built on behalf of the Sultan by
Genoese engineers, as is sometimes stated. In reality, it was
erected to keep intact the communications with Agadir, and to
protect the coasters who called in here. Nor is it any more
accurate to take for granted that because Sidi Mohammed ordered
a town to be laid out on the spot by M. Cornut, a French en.
gineer (a native of Avignon), who was for ten years in his service,
there was no previously existing place, or that the Europeans
first named it Mogador at that date, now more than 120 years
ago, though S'oueïra—“the image" or the picture—is the Moor-
ish name. The Touraine Capuchin Fathers, writing in 1644,
expressly mention that there was a fort on the island, and that
in 1628 Abd-el-Malik II. had intended to employ the Christian
slaves in the erection of fortifications around the Bay. But long
before that period there was a native town there, without pin-
ning our faith to the suggestion that this was the site of the
Tamusiga of Ptolemy, or of a more modern place marked on
various seventeenth-century maps as Sufega or Suriga. But it
is very doubtful whether S'oueïra is a corruption of that word,
as some ingenious antiquaries have imagined. The name is in
reality of modern origin, and in the Berber language Tasourt,
their designation for the town, has the same meaning. On the

indeed that bot one of their he made a vos
northern side of the Tengift river, amid sands and marshes,
there are the ruins of another small town which also bore the
name of S'oueira: it was deserted long ago.
“ Mogador," though doubtless derived from the tomb or sanc-
tuary of Sidi Mogdul or Mogdor in the vicinity of the town, is of
very much older date, Hodius's chart of 1608 having “ I. Dome-
gador” marked on it, and this is copied from others of a more
remote period, and in documents as early as 1660 “Mogator” is
repeatedly referred to as a place of trade. The sanctuary of
Sidi Mogdul--the guardian saint of the town-is of very ancient
origin, so remote indeed that both the Jews and the Moors con-
tend for the saint having been one of their people, and do him
equal honour. In 1604 Captain John Smith made a voyage to
“ Sancta Oruse, Cape Goa (Ghir) and Magadore.” But though
the Sidi-Mogdul legends are connected with a ship coming from
the sea, I am unable to discover any foundation for the notion
that he was a wrecked Danish captain, far less, as Mr. Harris
puts it so circumstantially, "a Scotchman McDougal,” who in
the Middle Ages lived among the natives, whose old village is
still near the town, and taught them many useful arts. The
Arabs, it is true, are fond of making saints out of rather
flimsy material. Between “ Morocco and the Atlas ” Monsieur
Charant, who lived in the country before the year 1660, notes
that there is a place called “ Gomet” (probably Aghmat, the
old capital of the Almoravides), where a monument exists
which the Moors in his day pretended to have been St.
Augustine's, “ whom they call Sid Belabech," and every one who
has visited the site of Carthage will remember the white native
village of Sidi Bou-Saeed, a spot so holy that until lately no
Christian was allowed to live in the place. Yet Sidi Bou-Saeed
is affirmed by the Arabs to have been St. Louis, who on his
death-bed became a convert to Al-Islam, and is interred there
under that name. However, the historical difficulties regarding
Sidi-Mogdul have never interfered with the esteem in which he
is held. He is the patron saint of Mogador, and when I was
there in 1886, the muleteers were hastily driving their animals
into his sanctuary on a report getting abroad that the
governor would be pressing them for the service of the French
minister, who was then in the town on his way to the city of
Morocco, on one of those useless “ diplomatic missions" which

prove so expensive to the villagers, who have to defray the
cost of the sumptuous journey of the “ 'bashdor" and his friends
though in the polite parlance of an official report these useless
jaunts are described as being at the cost of the Sultan!
(38) Argaireens, or Argireens, pp. 130, 306.-—" Argiers " was
one of the old names of Algiers, the word being evidently a
corruption of the Spanish “ Argel.” The French “ Alger,” and
its modification “Algier,” are also in use by the older writers.
(39) A “ Tartan” and a “ Snow,” pp. 304, 308.—These were
names applied at that date to particular builds of vessels. A
“snow," for instance, as my friend Captain Warren, R.N.,
informs me, was “a brig which set her boom mainsail on a
trysail mast, instead of, as in the present way, on the mast
itself.” A "tartan,” Commander Robinson, R.N.—who also has
obligingly favoured me with some notes on the subject-remarks,
is a small coasting vessel peculiar to the Mediterranean. It has
only one mast and a bowsprit; the principal sail, which is ex-
tremely large, is extended by a lateen-yard. This is a long spar
used to extend the three-cornered lateen sail upon; it is slung
about one quarter from the lower end, which is brought down to
the tack, while the upper end is raised in the air at an angle of
about forty-five degrees. When the wind is aft a square sail is
generally hoisted on the tartan, like a cross-jack. This craft-
now seldom seen-does not appear to have differed considerably
from the “ felucca” so familiar in the Mediterranean. Its
ancient name was “ targia," which suggests the possible deriva-
tion of the name. « Can it have come," Commander Robinson
suggests, “ from Tarhish or Tarragona ? I find also that an
ancient term for a vessel of any kind which carried a cargo, as
distinguished from a vessel built for fighting only, was 'tarita.'”
(40) Mamora or Mehedia, p. 313.—This is now a poor
neglected though picturesque place, with a shoaled-up harbour at
the mouth of the Sebou River, with no trade except the catching of
the shebbel, or shad, the only good fresh-water fish of Morocco.
From 1614, when Don Louis Fajardo captured it for the King
of Spain, to 1681, when the weak, dispirited garrison surrendered

it to Kaïd Amor-Hadou on behalf of Muley Ismail, the town
was a fief of His Catholic Majesty. But it was never of great
importance, though it did more business then than it has ever
done since. The object of Spain in seizing upon it was to root
out the nest of pirates it had become, and it is said by con-
temporary writers that there were at the time more Christians
there following the business than Moors. This confirms Captain
John Smith's assertion (p. 11), that the Morocco Moors were
taught the art of sea-robbery by English outlaws, and that they
in their turn (reversing the usual legend) initiated their country-
men exiled from Spain in what was subsequently their principal
trade. But no sooner did Mamora get free of the Infidels than
it returned to its evil ways. For here on the 13th of June, 1685,
Thomas Phelps and Edmund Baxter, escaping from “Machanes"
(Mequinez), helped to burn "two of the greatest Pirat-Ships
belonging to Barbary."
(41) Passing the Straits of Gibraltar, p. 315.-The frolic
described is evidently & survival from the days when the
Carthaginian mariners sacrificed to the gods on passing what
a pillar at Gibraltar even in Edrisi's day proclaimed to be the
limits of navigation. The ceremonies have been long discontinued,
though something of the kind is practised on novices who for the
first time pass “the Line," and among the Arctic whalers on
May Day, as I have fully described elsewhere.*
(42) Gibraltar, p. 320.-General Sabine was the thirteenth
governor of Gibraltar, viz., from 1730, when he succeeded
General Clayton, to 1789, when General Columbine took his
place. The excessive precautions taken to prevent any Moor
from entering the fortress may seem absurd to those of us who
remember the picturesque crowds of Barbary folk lounging in
the Waterport Street, the little steamer from Tangier full of
Moslem egg and fowl merchants, and the forty or fiſty Moors,
most of them native-born subjects of her Majesty, resident on
the rock. But in 1738 treachery was abroad, and the fortress
had only recently stood its thirteenth siege. To this day all
comers are questioned, those of British nationality being alone
permitted to tarry without certain inoffensive formalities, touch-
ing guarantees for their good behaviour. The other gentlemen

mentioned by Pellow were officials at the time of his story, as
an examination of the Colonial records proves.
(43) The Moorish Ambassador, p. 827.–This envoy was El Hajj
Abdel Kadr Perez, Admiral of Sallee. He was succeeded by
“Abroggly," who came back with Mr. Consul Russel from England
in 1727. At a later date several others arrived on various
missions, among others Tahar Fenishe, in the reign of
George III. It is therefore far from accurate to state, as is
still mentioned in some “works of reference,” that the am-
bassador from Sidi Mohammed ben Abd-er-Rhaman, who
arrived in June, 1860, was the first “since the time of Charles
II.” One of the early English envoys to the Court of Morocco
- Sir James Losely, Captain Nicholson, Lord Howard, or Cap-
tain Kirk of “ Kirk's Lambs, for statements differ—being
obliged to appear barefooted before Muley Ismail,"* Mohammed
Ben Hadou Ottar, the Moorish Envoy who was sent to Charles
II., was compelled to submit to the indignity of being received
at court without shoes, turban, or fez.
Morocco is, however, even yet the one country with which we
have diplomatic relations, where the Christian envoy has to
submit to more or less degrading observances at the hands of
the Moslem ruler. An ambassador is received by the Sultan in
the courtyard of his palace, the “Prince of True Believers"
sitting haughtily on horseback while the envoy of a great power
stands humbly bareheaded at his side, presenting to him the
members of his suite, and expressing the diplomatic common.
places suited to the occasion. He has not even the protection of
an umbrella from the burning sun, though the Sultan has
borne over his head the great silken paraschute which is so
much the emblem of his authority that when he entered Tetuan
and Tangier in the summer of 1889, a notice was issued that no
person in the crowd waiting to receive him was to put up their
sunshades. Slaves also go 'on either side of him with silk
handkerchiefs flicking the flies from his hands and face. Should
the Embassy be afterwards favoured with a more private
interview, it takes place in a kiosque in the garden, and even

luty is as ofteneir mission, the solare compelled to
ador in Chiefed a punishmion of a dien;
then this distinction is not always accorded, and chiefly in order
that the presents which invariably accompany an embassy should
be presented and explained to the Sultan. Such gifts, though
possessing in the eyes of the giver no more meaning than those
sent by one European sovereign to another, are sedulously repre-
sented to the ignorant Moors as tribute sent by the Infidels to the
Leader of the Faithful, and should be discontinued, more especially
as the courtesy accorded to an envoy is apt to be in an exact
ratio to the value of the gifts he bears. In any case the Powers
ought at once to insist on being received in the person of their
envoys on the same terms that the Sultan's ambassadors are
when he sends, as he has of late years been fond of doing,
representatives for the purpose of condoling with, or congratula-
ting, his brethren in the West. These envoys are usually two
or more in number, and as they are compelled to defray the
expenses of their mission, the selection of a dignitary for this
duty is as often considered a punishment as an honour. For if
the Ambassador in Chief does not spend lavishly, he is certain to
be represented by his colleagues and rivals as lowering the dignity
of their Lord and Master by behaving niggardly before the In-
fidels. The return presents usually consist of a horse to the am-
bassador and a sword to each of his suite. The horse is not very
often a Barb of the first quality, but it is accompanied by a
“ permit,” without which no horse, mule, camel, cow, goat,
sheep, or donkey is allowed to go out of the country; 80
that the animal can be sent to a profitable market on the other
side of Gibraltar Strait. Time was, when no Christian or Jew
-not even a Consul—could enter holy cities like Saffi or Fez
without dismounting from their animals, and even yet, the same
invidious formality, plus taking off their slippers, is demanded
from Jews when they enter the Moorish quarters in the interior
towns, or pass a mosque. Last century and well into the
present one, no Christian or Jew could enter the Moorish
quarters of Fez without a permit from the Emperor; and to this
hour, for either to try and pass the street in which is situated
the mosque of Muley Idris would be to endanger the life of the
rash intruder. As for attempting to visit the town of Muley
Idris, and other sacred spots—no one as yet has openly ventured
on that dangerous experiment.

official efforts to differentiate between the Infidel and the followers
of the Prophet, Tripoli, indeed, being the only one of them
with the exception of Morocco which is not directly or indirectly
under Frankish rule. Algeria is a colony of France, so that the
days are over when the insolent pirate-chiefs treated Consuls
with contumely, found fault with their presents, and insisted on
more frequent changes in order that this form of tribute should
come less sparingly. Tunis also, though a “ Protectorate,” is to
all intents and purposes a dependency of France. But there are
men still young who can remember when no person except the
Bey could drive in a four-wheeled carriage, and not far from the
Kasbah was a gate called Bab-es-silsilah-through which until
sixty or seventy years ago it was death for a Christian to pass.
But these were in the happy times when-
“ Nsara fe Senaara !
Lehood fe Sefood !".
“To the hook with the Nazarene !
To the spit with the Jew !”
was a maledictory couplet of something more than academic
import. No Christian can enter any mosque in Morocco, or
with one exception any in Tunisia. But the exception is
sufficiently remarkable, for it happens to be that of Sidi Okba
in the sacred city of Kairwan, which, a few years ago, no
unauthorized infidel could visit unless he was prepared to be
stoned or even worse treated. Nowadays, you can trundle over
the plain between it and Susa on iron rails, and the keeper of
the Great Mosque holds out his hands for the five-franc piece as
if he had been bred to the vergership of an English cathedral
Morocco is still, in the interior at least, not very different from
what it was a thousand years ago. But “ Tunica ricca ed on-
orata sede" has fallen from its high estate. For the Nazarene
sits in the seat of the Bey, and a Juge d'instruction interprets
the law. Newsboys and shoeblacks ply their trades in sight of
Rubbatinos railway station, and over the blood-sodden soil,
where less than a century ago Christian slaves toiled under the
Turkish lash, Arab cabmen drive furiously. You can take the
train to Carthage, and the diligence to Utica and Sicca Veneria.
And all day long past cafés where cogging Greeks bargain over
their absinthe is heard the hoarse cry of the tramway conduc-
tor-_" Place Bab Carthagène! Four karrobas all the way!”
