PREFACE. 
 
 ONE of the first observations the author of the 
 following sheets made upon his return to his na 
 tive country, after an absence of seven years, was 
 the extreme avidity with which books of mere 
 amusement were purchased and perused by all 
 ranks g& his countrymen. When he left New Eng 
 land, books of biography, travels, novels, and mod 
 ern romances, were confined to our seaports ; or, 
 if known in the country, were read only in the 
 families of clergymen, physicians, and lawyers : 
 while certain funeral discourses, the last words and 
 dying speeches of Bryan Shaheen, and Levi Ames, 
 and some dreary somebody s Day of Doom, formed 
 the most diverting part of the farmer s library. On 
 his return from captivity, he found a surprising 
 alteration in the public taste. In our inland towns 
 of consequence, social libraries had been instituted, 
 composed of books designed to amuse rather than to 
 instruct; and country booksellers, fostering the new 
 born taste of the people, had filled the whole land 
 with modern travels, and novels almost as incredi 
 ble. The diffusion of a taste for any species of 
 writing through all ranks, in so short a time, would 
 appear impracticable to an European. The pea 
 sant of Europe must first be taught to read, before 
 he can acquire a taste in letters. In New England, 
 the work is half completed. In no other country

VI PREFACE. 
 
 are there so many people, who, in proportion to 
 its numbers, can read and write ; and, therefore, 
 no sooner was a taste for amusing literature diffused, 
 than all orders of country life, with one accord, 
 forsook the sober sermons and practical pieties of 
 their fathers, for the gay stories and splendid im 
 pieties of the traveller and the novelist. The wor 
 thy farmer no longer fatigued himself with Bun- 
 yan s Pilgrim up the hill of difficulty, or through 
 the &amp;lt; slough of despond ; but quaffed wine with 
 Brydone in the hermitage of Vesuvius, or sported 
 with Bruce on the fairy- land of Abyssinia : while 
 Dolly the dairy maid, and Jonathan the hi**d man, 
 threw aside the ballad of the cruel step-mother, 
 over which they had so often wept in cencert, and 
 now amused themselves into so agreeable a terror 
 with the haunted houses and hobgoblins of Mrs. 
 Ratcliffe, that they were both afraid to sleep alone. 
 Although a lover of literature, however frivolous, 
 may be pleasing to the man of letters, yet there 
 are two things to be deplored in it. The first is, 
 that, while so many books are vended, they are 
 not of our own manufacture. If our wives and 
 daughters will wear gauze and ribbands, it is a 
 pity they are not wrought in our own looms. The 
 second misfortune is, that novels, being the picture 
 of the times, the New England reader is insensibly 
 taught to admire the levity, and often the vices, 
 of the parent country. While the fancy is enchant 
 ed, the heart is corrupted. The farmer s daughter, 
 while she pities the misfortune of some modern 
 heroine, is exposed to the attacks of vice, from 
 which her ignorance would have formed her surest 
 shield. If the English novel does not inculcate

 vice, it at least impresses on the young female mind 
 an erroneous idea of the world in which she is to 
 live. It paints the manners, customs, and habits, 
 of a strange country ; excites a fondness for false 
 splendor ; and renders the home-spun habits of her 
 own country disgusting. 
 
 There are two things wanted, said a friend to 
 the author : that we write our own books of amuse 
 ment, and that they exhibit our own manners. 
 Why then do you not write the history of your 
 own life ? The first part of it, if not highly inter 
 esting, would at least display a portrait of New 
 England manners, hitherto unattempted. Your 
 captivity among the Algerines, with some notices 
 of the manners of that ferocious race, so dreaded 
 by commercial powers, and so little known in our 
 country, would at least be interesting ; and I see 
 no advantage which the novel writer can have over 
 you, unless your readers should be of the senti 
 ment of the young lady mentioned by Addison in 
 his Spectator, who, as he informs us, borrowed 
 Plutarch s Lives, and, after reading the first volume 
 with infinite delight, supposing it to be a novel y 
 threw aside the others with disgust, because a man 
 of letters had inadvertently told her the work wa? 
 founded on FACT.

 ARGUMENT, 
 
 Tlie Author gives an Account ofhi$ gallant Jl?ices.- 
 tor, Captain John Underhill,~his arrival in Mas 
 sachusetts) and Persecution by the first Settlers. 
 
 I DERIVE my birth from one of the first emigrants 
 to New England, being lineally descended from 
 captain John Underbill, who came into the Massa 
 chusetts in the year 1630; of ivhom honourable 
 mention is made by that elegant, accurate, and in 
 teresting historian, the Rev. Jeremy Belknap, in 
 his History of New Hampshire. 
 
 My honoured ancestor had early imbibed an ar 
 dent love of liberty, civil and religious, by his ser 
 vice as a soldier among the Dutch, in their glorious 
 and successful struggle for freedom, with Philip 11. 
 of Spain ; in which, though quite a youth, he held 
 a commission in the earl of Leicester s own troop 
 of guards, who was then sent to the assistance of 
 that brave people, by the renowned queen Eliza 
 beth of England.

 The extravagant passion which that princess was 
 supposed to entertain for various male favourites, 
 which occasioned the disgrace of one and the pre 
 mature death of another, while it has furnished a 
 darling theme to the novelist, and has been wept 
 over in the tragic scene, has never yet received 
 the sober sanction of the historian. 
 
 A traditional family anecdote, while it places 
 the aiietion of the queen for Leicester beyond 
 doubt, 1 may not be unpleasing to the learned rea 
 der, and may .benefit the English historiographer. 
 
 it is. well known that this crafty queen, though 
 repeatedly solicited, never efficaciously assisted 
 the Netherlander, until their affairs were appa 
 rently at the lowest ebb, and they in such despe 
 rate circumstances as to offer the sovereignty of 
 their country to her general, the earl of Leicester. 
 Captain Underbill carried the dispatches to Eng 
 land, and delivered them at the office of lord Bur- 
 leigh. The same evening the queen sent for the 
 captain, and, with apparent perturbation, inquired 
 of him, if he was the messenger from Leicester, 
 and whether he had any private dispatches for her. 
 He replied, that he had delivered all his letters to 
 the secretary of state. She appeared much dis 
 appointed, and, after musing some time, said 
 &quot; So, Leicester wants to be a king.&quot; Underbill, 
 who was in the general s confidence, replied, that 
 the Dutch had indeed made the offer of the sove 
 reignty of their country to her general esteeming 
 it a great honour, as they said, to have a subject 
 of her grace for their sovereign. &quot; No.&quot; replied 
 the queen, &quot; it is not the Dutch ; they hate kings 
 and their divine right ; it is the proud Leicester,

 who longs to be independent of his own sovereign, 
 who moves this insolent proposal. Tell him, from 
 me, that he must learn to obey before he is fit to 
 govern. Tell him,&quot; added the queen, softening 
 her voice, &quot; that obedience may make him a king 
 indeed.&quot; Immediately after captain Underbill had 
 taken the public dispatches, the queen sent for him 
 to her privy closet, recalled her verbal message, 
 delivered him a letter for Leicester directed with 
 her own hand, and a purse of one hundred crowns 
 for himself ; charging him to inclose the letter in 
 lead, sink it in case of danger in his passage by 
 sea, and to deliver it privately. On the receipt 
 of this letter, Leicester was violently agitated, and 
 walked his chamber the whole of the ensuing 
 night. Soon after, he resigned his command, and 
 returned to England, animated by the brightest 
 hopes of realizing the lofty suggestions of his am 
 bition. With him captain Underbill returned, and 
 upon the decease, ot the earl of Leicester, attached 
 himself to the fortunes of the earl of Essex, the un 
 fortunate successor to Leicester in the queen s fa 
 vour. He accompanied that gallant nobleman in 
 his successful attack upon Cadiz, and shared his 
 ill fortune in hisffruitjess expedition against Ty 
 ronne, the rebel chief of the revolted clans of Ire 
 land ; and, returning with the earl into England, 
 by his attachment to that imprudent nobleman, 
 sallying into the streets of London in the petty in 
 surrection which cost Essex his head, he was obli 
 ged to seek safety in Holland, until the accession 
 of king James, in 1603, when he applied for par 
 don, and leave to return to his native country, 
 &quot;Bart that monarch entertained such an exalted idea

 of the dignity of kings, and, from policy, affected 
 so great a veneration for the memory of his pre 
 decessor, that no interest of his friends could pro 
 cure his pardon for an offence which, at this day, 
 in this country, would be considered a simple rout 
 or riot, and punished with a small fine. In that 
 age of kingly glory, however, it was supposed to 
 combine treason and blasphemy : treason against 
 the queen in her political capacity, and blasphe 
 my against her as God s representative and vice 
 gerent on earth. 
 
 The reverend Mr. Robinson, with a number of 
 other pious puritans, who fled from the persecuting 
 fury of the English prelates, to Holland, in 1603, 
 dwelt and communed with them a number of years. 
 He was strongly solicited to go with governor Car 
 ver, Elder Brewster, and the other worthies, part 
 of Mr. Robinson s church, to the settlement of Ply 
 mouth, and had partly engaged with them, as their 
 chief military officer ; but captain Miles Standish, 
 his brave fellow-soldier in the Low Countries, un 
 dertaking the business, he declined. 
 
 How he joined governor Winthrop does not ap 
 pear, but he came over to New England with him, 
 and soon after we find him disciplining the Boston 
 militia, where he was held in such high estimation, 
 that he was chosen to represent that town in the 
 general court ; but his ideas of religious toleration 
 being more liberal than those around him, he lost 
 his popularity, and was, on the 20th of November, 
 1637, disfranchised, and eventually banished the 
 jurisdiction of Massachusetts. 
 
 The writers of those times differ as to the par 
 ticular offence for which he was punished. Some

 -aj that it was for holding the antinomian tenets 
 of the celebrated Anne Hutchinson ; others, that 
 the charge against him was for saying, &quot; That the 
 government of Boston were as zealous as the scribes 
 and pharisees, and as Paul before his conversion. 5 * 
 The best account I have been able to collect is, 
 that at the time when the zeal of our worthy fore 
 fathers burned the hottest against heretics and sec 
 taries ; when good Roger Williams, who settled 
 Providence, the pious Wheelwright, and others, 
 were banished ; he (with about sixty other im 
 prudent persons, who did not believe in the then 
 popular argument of fines, imprisonment, disfran- 
 chisement, confiscation, banishments, and halters 
 for the conversion of infidels) supposed that the 
 Christian faith, which had spread so wonderfully 
 in its infancy, when the sword of civil power \vas 
 drawn against it, needed not the same sword un 
 sheathed in its favour, in an age when it was sur 
 rounded by numerous proselytes. These mista 
 ken people signed a remonstrance against the vio 
 lent proceedings which were the order of that day. 
 William Aspinwall and John Coggeshell, two of 
 the Boston representatives, who signed the remon 
 strance, were sent home, and the town ordered to 
 choose others in their room. Some of the remon 
 strants recanted, some were fined, some were dis- 
 iranchised, and others, among whom was captain 
 Underbill, were banished. 
 
 It is said by some authors, that he was charged 
 with the heinous crime of adultery, and that he 
 even confessed it. The candid American author 
 above named has fallen into this error. As I am 
 sure it must have given him pain to sneak cell

 even of the dead, so I am certain he will rectify 
 the mistake in the next edition f his invaluable 
 history. 
 
 That author informs us, in page 43 of his first 
 volume, &quot; That he, captain Underhill, was pri 
 vately dealt with, on suspicion of adultery, which 
 he disregarded ; and therefore on the next sab 
 bath was questioned for it before the church ; but 
 the evidence not being sufficient to convict him, 
 the church could only admonish him.&quot; Page 45, 
 &quot; He went to Boston, and in the same public man 
 ner acknowledged his adultery. But his confes 
 sion was mixed with so many excuses and exten 
 uations, that it gave no satisfaction.&quot; 
 
 The unwary reader would perhaps conclude, 
 that actual adultery was intended, as well as ex 
 pressed, in these extracts. The reverend author 
 himself did not advert to the idea, that the moral 
 law of Boston, in 1637, was not so lax as the 
 moral law of the same place in 1784, as explained 
 by the practice of its inhabitants. The rigid 
 discipline of our fathers of that era often construed 
 actions, expressions, and sometimes thoughts, into 
 crimes ; which actions, in this day, even the most 
 precise would consider either innocent, indiffer 
 ent, or beneath the dignity of official notice. 
 The fact is, that captain Underhill, so far from 
 confessing, was never charged with committing, 
 actual statute-book adultery. At a certain lecture 
 in Boston, instead of noting in his Bible the 
 texts referred to, according to the profitable custom 
 of the times, this gallant soldier had fixed his eyes 
 steadfastly, and perhaps inordinately, upon one 
 mistress Miriam Wilbore ; who it seems was,

 at that very time, herself in the breach of the 
 spirit of an existing law, which forbade women 
 to appear in public with uncovered arms and 
 necks, by appearing at the same lecture with a 
 pair of wanton open worked gloves, slit at the 
 thumbs and fingers, for the conveniency of taking 
 snuff: though she was not charged with this lat 
 ter crime of using tobacco. It was the adultery 
 of the hearty then of which my gallant ancestor 
 was accused, and founded on that text of Scrip 
 ture, &quot; Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust 
 after her, hath committed adultery with her al^ 
 ready in his heart.&quot;

 It should be premised, that in the year 1636, 
 the governor, deputy governor, three assistants, 
 and three ministers (among whom was Hugh Pe 
 ters, afterwards hung and quartered in England 
 for his adherance to Oliver Cromwell,) were en 
 treated by the Massachusetts court to make a 
 draught of laws, agreeable to the word of God, 
 to report to the next general court ; and, in the 
 interim, the magistrates were directed to deter

 mitted wilh one mistress Miriam Wilbore, wife 
 of Samuel Wilbore, for carnally looking to luste 
 after her, at the lecture in Boston, when master 
 Shepherd expounded. This mistress Miriam hath 
 since been dealte with for coming to that lecture 
 wilh a pair of wanton open workt gloves, slit at 
 (he thumbs and fingers, for the purpose of taking 
 snuff ; for, as master Cotton observed, for what 
 end should those vaine opennings be, but for ,the 
 intent of taken filthy snuff? and he quoted Gregory 
 Nazianzen upon good works. Master Peters said, 
 that these opennings were Satan s. port-holes of firy 
 temptatione. Mistress Miriam offerd in excuse of 
 her vain attire&amp;gt; that she was newle married, and 
 appeard in her bridall arraye. Master Peters said 
 that marriage was the occasion that the devil tooke 
 io caste his fiery darts, and lay his pit-falls of 
 temptation, to catch frale flesh and bloode. She 
 is to be further dealt with for taken snuff. How the 
 ;je of the good creature tobaccoe can be an offence 
 I cannot see. Oh, my beloved, how these prowde

 relinquished the delights of their native country, 
 crossed a boisterous ocean, penetrated a savage 
 wilderness, encountered famine, pestilence, and

 the natives. It is said that he killed one hundred 
 and fifty Indians on Long Island, and upwards of 
 three hundred on the Main. The laurels of the 
 famous colonel Church wither in this comparison. 
 The Dutch granted him fifty thousand acres of -

 never availed themselves of the grant. When I 
 mentioned this circumstance some time since in 
 Hertford, certain gentlemen immediately offered to 
 raise a company and purchase my right. I can~ 
 didly confessed that I was not possessed of the ti 
 tle, and knew not the particular spot where the 
 land lay, and consequently was unwilling to sell 
 land without title or boundaries. To my surprise 
 they laughed ctt my scruples, and observed that 
 they wanted the land to speculate upon ; to sell, 
 and not to settle. Titles and boundaries, in such 
 cases, I understood were indifferent matters, mere 
 trifles. 
 
 My- brave ancestor, at an advanced age, died 
 in Albany, leaving two sons ; the youngest of 
 whom removed to the Mouth of Hudson, where 
 some of his posterity flourish respectably to this 
 day. The eldest son, Benoni, from whom I am 
 descended, some years after his father s decease, 
 after being the subject of various misfortunes, re 
 turned in impoverished circumstances to New 
 Hampshire, where the family have continued ever 
 since.

 The Author recitcth a Dream of Sir William 
 PhippSy Governor of Massachusetts, and refer- 
 
 | reth small Infidels to Mather s Magnolia. 
 
 I WAS born on the 16th of July, A. D. 1762. My 
 mother, some months before my birth, dreamt that 
 she was delivered of me ; that I was lying in the 
 cradle ; that the house was beset by Indians, who 
 broke into the next room, and took me into the 
 fields with them ; that, alarmed by their hideous 
 yellings and war whoops, she ran to the window, 
 and saw a number of young tawny savages playing 
 at foot-ball with my head ; while several sachems 
 and sagamores were looking on unconcerned. 
 
 This dream made a deep impression on my mo 
 ther. I well recollect, when a boy, her stroking 
 my flaxen locks, repeating her dream, and observ 
 ing with a sigh to my father, that she was sure Up 
 dike was born to be the sport of fortune, and that

 he would one day suffer among, savages. Dear 
 woman ! she had the native Indians in her mind, 
 but never apprehended her poor son s suffering 
 many years, as a slave, among barbarians more 
 cruel than the monsters of our &quot;own woods. 
 
 The learned reader will smile contemptuously, 
 perhaps, upon my mentioning dreams in this en 
 lightened age. I only relate facts, and leave the 
 reader to his own comments. My own opinion of 
 dreams I shall conceal, perhaps because 1 am 
 ashamed to disclose it. 1 will venture to observe., 
 that if we inspect the sacred scriptures, we shall 
 find frequent instances, both of direction to duty, 
 and forewarning of future events communicated by 
 Providence through the intervention of dreams. 
 Is not the modern Christian equally the care of 
 indulgent heaven as the favoured Jew or the be- 
 Joved patriarch ? 
 
 Many modern examples of the foreboding vi 
 sions of the night may be adduced. William 
 Phipps, a poor journeyman ship-carpenter, dreamt, 
 that he should one day ride in his coach, and live 
 in a grand house near Boston common. Many 
 years afterwards, when he was knighted by Wil 
 liam the Third, and came from England governor 
 of Massachusetts Bay, this dream, even as to the 
 situation of the grand house, was literally and 
 minutely fulfilled. If the insect infidels of the 
 day doubt this fact, let them consult, for their edi 
 fication, the learned doctor Mather s Magnalia, 
 where the whole story at large is minutely and 
 amply related. It was the error of the times of 
 monkish ignorance to believe every thing ; it may

 IN my childhood I was sent, as is customary, to 
 a woman s school in the summer, and to a man s 
 in the winter season, and made great progress in 
 such learning as my preceptors dealt in. About 
 my twelfth year, our minister, who made it his cus 
 tom to inspect the schools annually, came to our dis 
 trict. My master, who looked upon me as his best 
 scholar, directed me to read a lesson in Dilworth s 
 spelling-book, which I recited as loud as I could 
 speak without regard to emphasis or stops. This 
 so pleased our minister, who prided himself on the 
 strength of his own lungs, that, a short time after, 
 coming to my father s to dicker , as they styled it, 
 about a swap of cattle, and not finding my father 
 sharp at the bargin, he changed the discourse up 
 on me, observing, &quot;how delighted he was with my 
 performances at school. What a pity it was such 
 a genius was not encouraged I Mr. Underbill,

 you must put Updike to learning.&quot; My lather 
 pleaded poverty. &quot; When 1 went to Harvard col 
 lege,&quot; replied the minister, &quot; I was poor indeed. 
 I had no father with a good farm to assist me ; 
 but, with being butler s freshman, and ringing the 
 bell the first year, waiter the three last, and keep 
 ing school in the vacations, I rubbed through, and 
 am now what I am ; and who knows,&quot; continued 
 he, &quot; but when Updike has completed his educa 
 tion, he may make a minister ; and possibly, 
 when my usefulness is over, supply our very 
 pulpit?&quot; . 
 
 lily mother here interfered. She was a little, 
 spare woman. My father was a large bony man, 
 famous, in his youth, for carrying the ring at 
 wrestling; and, in his latter years, for his perse 
 verance at town meetings. But, notwithstanding 
 my father s success in carrying points abroad, my 
 mother, some how or other, contrived always to 
 carry them at home. My father never would ac- 
 knewledge this ; but when a coarse neighbour 
 would sometimes slily hint the adage of the grey 
 mare being the better horse, he would say to his 
 particular friends, that he always was conqueror 
 in his domestic warfare : but would confess that 
 he loved quiet, and was of late tired of perpetu 
 ally getting the victory. My mother joined the 
 minister, observing that Updike should have 
 learning, though she worked her hands to the bone 
 to procure it. She did not doubt, when he came 
 to preach, he would be as much run after as the 
 great Mr. Whitfield. &quot; I always- thought,&quot; con 
 tinued she, u the child was a genius ; and al 
 ways intended he should go to college, The

 boy loves books. He has read Valentine and 
 Orson, and Robinson Crusoe. I went, the other 
 day, three miles to borrow Pilgrim s Progress for 
 him. He has read it through every bit ; ay, and 
 understands it too. Why, he stuck a skewer 
 through Apollyon s eye in the picture, to help 
 Christian beat him. My father could not- answer 
 my mother s argument. The dicker about the oxen 
 was renewed ; and it was concluded to swap even, 
 though my father s were much the likelier cattle ; 
 and that I should go that week and study Latin 
 with the minister, and be fitted for college. 
 
 With him I studied four years, labouring inces 
 santly at Greek and Latin : as to English gram- 
 Hiar, my preceptor, knowing nothing of it him 
 self, could communicate nothing to me. As he 
 was enthusiastically attached to the Greek, and 
 had delivered an oration in that language at the 
 commencement at Cambridge, when he took his 
 first degree, I, by his direction, committed to me 
 mory above four hundred of the most sonorous lines 
 in Homer, which I was called to repeat before a 
 number of clergymen, who visited him at an an 
 nual convention in our parish. These gentlemen 
 were ever pleased to express astonishing admira 
 tion at my literary acquirements. One of them 
 prognosticated that I should be a general, from 
 the fire and force with which I recited Homer s 
 battles of the Greeks and Trojans. Another ar 
 gued that I should be a member of congress, and 
 equal the Adams s in oratory, from my repeating 
 the speeches at the councils of the heathen gods with 
 such attention to the caesura. A third was sure 
 that I should become a Witherspoon in divinity-.

 from the pathos with which I declaimed Jupiter s 
 speech to all the gods. In fine, these gentlemen 
 considered the classics the source of all valuable 
 knowledge. With them dead languages were 
 more estimable than living ; and nothing more 
 necessary to accomplish a young man for all that 
 is profitable and honourable in life than a profound 
 knowledge of Homer. One of them gravely obser 
 ved that he was sure general Washington read 
 Greek ; and that he never would have captured the 
 Hessians at Trenton, if he had not taken his plan 
 of operation from that of Ulysses and Diomede 
 seizing the horses of Rhesus, as described in the 
 tenth book of the Iliad. 
 
 , Thus flattered by the learned that I was in the 
 high road to fame, I gulped down portions of 
 Greek daily, while my preceptor made quarterly 
 visits to my father s barn-yaad for pay for my in 
 struction. 
 
 In June, 178b, my father began seriously to 
 think of sending me to college. He called upon 
 a neighbour, to whom he had sold part of his 
 farm, for some cash. His creditor readily paid 
 down the whole sum due, in paper money ; and 
 my father found, to his surprise, that the value of 
 three acres paid him the principal and interest of 
 the whole sum, for which he had sold seventy -five 
 acres of land five years before. This was so se 
 vere a stroke of ill fortune, that it entirely frustra 
 ted the design of sending ine to college.

 ARGUMENT. 
 
 This Chapter containeth an Eulogy on the Greek 
 Tongue. 
 
 WHAT added to the misfortune mentioned in the 
 last chapter was, that a worthy divine, settled in 
 Boston, passing through our town, told my father, 
 in a private conversation, that al! the Greek I had 
 acquired was of no other service than fitting me 
 for college. My father was astonished. He was 
 a plain unlettered man, of strong natural abilities. 
 &quot; Pray, reverend sir,&quot; said my father, &quot; do they 
 not learn this Greek language at college ? If 
 0, why do such wise men as the governors 
 of colleges teach boys what is entirely useless ? 
 1 thought that the sum of all good education was, 
 to teach youth those things which they were to 
 practise in after life.&quot; &quot; Learning,&quot; replied our 
 enlightened visitor, &quot; has its fashions ; and, like 
 other fashions of this world, they pass away. 
 When our forefathers founded the college at Cam 
 bridge, crrtical knowledge in the mazes and 
 subtleties of school divinity was all the mode. 
 He that could give a new turn to an old text, 
 or detect a mistranslation in the version, was 
 more admired than the man who invented printing, 
 discovered the magnetic powers, or contrived an 
 instrument of agriculture which should abridge the 
 labour of the husbandman. The books of our faith-,

 with the voluminous commentaries of the fathers, 
 being originally written in what are now called 
 the dead languages, the knowledge of those langua 
 ges was then necessary for the accomplishment of 
 the fashionable scholar. The moderns of New 
 England have ceased to interest themselves in the 
 disputes, whether a civil oath may be administered 
 to an unregenerate man ; or whether souls, existing 
 merely in the contemplation of Deity, are capable 
 of actual transgression. Fashion has given a new 
 direction to the pursuits of the learned. They no 
 longer soar into the regions of infinite space ; but 
 endeavour, by the aid of natural and moral philoso 
 phy, to amend the manners and better ihe condition 
 of man : and the college at Cambridge may be 
 assimilated to an old beau, with his pocket-holes 
 under his arm-pits, the skirts- of his coat to his an 
 kles, and three gross of buttons on his breeches ; 
 looking with contempt on the more easy useful 
 garb of the present day, for deviating from what 
 was fashionable in his youth. * 
 
 &quot; But,&quot; inquired my father, &quot; is there not 
 some valuable knowledge contained in those 
 Greek books ?&quot; &quot; All that is useful in them,&quot; replied 
 our visitor, &quot; is already translated into English ; 
 and more of the sense and spirit may be imbibed 
 from translations than most scholars would be able 
 to extract from the originals, if they even availed 
 themselves of such an acquaintance with that lan 
 guage as is usually acquired at college. 
 
 &quot; Well&quot; replied my father, &quot; do you call their, 
 dead laguages. It appears to me now, that con- 
 lining a lad of lively genius to the study of them,

 youth, is like the ingenious cruelty of those tyrants 
 I have heard of, who chained the living and the 
 dead together. If Updike went to college, I 
 should wish he would learn, not hard zvords but 
 useful things&quot; 
 
 * You spake of governors of colleges,&quot; contin 
 ued our visitor. &quot; Let me observe, as an apology 
 for the concern they may be supposed to have 
 in this error, that they are moral worthy men, who 
 have passed the same dull routine of education, and 
 whose knowledge is necessarily confined to these 
 defunct languages. They must teach their pupils 
 what they know, not what they do not know. 
 That measure which was measured unto them, 
 they mete out most liberally unto others.&quot; 
 
 &quot; Should not the legislature, as the fathers of the 
 people, interfere ?&quot; inquired my father. &quot; We 
 will not talk politics at this time,&quot; replied our 
 visitor. 
 
 My father was now determined that I should 
 not go to college. He concealed this conversation 
 from me, and 1 was left to be proud of my Greek. 
 The little advantage this deceased &amp;gt; language has 
 since been to me has often caused me sorely to 
 regret the inispending of the time in acquiring it. 
 The French make it no part of their academical 
 studies. Voltaire, d Alembert, and Diderot, when 
 they completed their education, were probably 
 ignorant of the cognata te.mpora of a Greek verb. 
 
 It was re?olved that I should labour on my fa 
 ther s farm ; but, alas ! a taste for Greek had quite 
 eradicated a love for labour. Poring so intensely 
 on Homer and Virgil had so completely tilled my 
 brain with the heathen mythology, that I hnagin*

 ed a hamadryad in every sapling, a nai ad in every 
 puddle ; and expected to hear the sobbings of the 
 infant fauns as I turned the furrow. I gave Greek 
 names to all our farming tools, and cheered the 
 cattle with hexameter verse. My father s hired 
 men, after a tedious day s labour in the woods, 
 inspecting our stores for refreshment, instead of the 
 customary bread and cheese and brandy, found 
 Homer s Iliad, Virgil Delphini, and Schrevelius s 
 Lexicon, in the basket. 
 
 After I had worked on the farm some months, 
 having killed a fat heifer of my father s, upon 
 which the family depended for their winter s beef, 
 covered it with green boughs, and laid it in the 
 shade to putrefy, in order to raise, a swarm of bees* 
 after the manner of Virgil which process, not

 How was my heart dilated with the prospect, 
 in the tedious interval previous to my entering up 
 on my school ! How often have 1 stood suspended 
 over my dungfork, and anticipated my scholars, 
 seated in awful silence around me, my arm-chair 
 and birchen sceptre of authority ! There was an 
 echo in my father s sheep pasture. More than 
 once I have repaired there alone, and exclaimed, 
 with a loud voice, Is master Updike Underbill at 
 home ? I would speak with master Underbill ! for 
 the pleasure of hearing how my title sounded. 
 Dost thou smile, indignant reader ? pause, and re 
 collect if these sensations have not been familiar 
 to thee, at some time in thy life. If thou answer- 
 est disdainfully no then I aver thou hast never 
 been a corporal in the militia, nor a sophomore at 
 college. 
 
 At times I however entertained less pleasing, 
 but more rational, contemplations on my prospects. 
 As I had been once unmercifully whipped, for 
 detecting my master in a false concord, I resolved 
 to be mild in my government, to avoid all manu 
 al correction, and doubted not by these means to 
 secure the love and respect of my pupils. 
 
 In the interim of school hours, and in those 
 peaceful intervals when my pupils were engaged 
 in study, I hoped to indulge myself with my fa 
 vourite Greek. I expected to be overwhelmed 
 with the gratitude of their parents, for pouring the 
 fresh instruction over the minds of their children, 
 and teaching their young ideas how to shoot. I 
 anticipated independence from my salary, which 
 was to be equal to four dollars, hard money, per 
 month, and my boarding : and expected to fin&amp;lt;[

 amusement and pleasure among the circles of the 
 young, and to derive information and delight from 
 the classic converse of the minister. 
 
 In due time my ambition &amp;gt;vns gratified, and I 
 placed at the head of a school, consisting of about 
 sixty scholars. Excepting three or four overgrown 
 boys of eighteen, the generality of them were un 
 der the age of seven years. Perhaps a more rag 
 ged, ill-bred, ignorant set, never were collected, 
 for the punishment of a poor pedagogue. To 
 study in school was impossible. Instead of the 
 silence I anticipated, there was an incessant clam 
 our. Predominant among the jarring sounds were 
 Sir, may I read ? May 1 spell ? Master may I 
 go out? YVill master mend my pen ? What with 
 the pouting of the small children, sent to school 
 not to learn, but to keep them out of harm s way, 
 and the gruff surly complaints of the larger ones, 
 I was nearly distracted. Homer s poluphloisboio 
 tkalasses, roariiig sea, was a whisper to it. My 
 resolution to avoid beating them made me invent 
 small punishments, which often have a salutary 
 impression on delicate minds ; but they were in 
 sensible to shame. The putting of a paper fool s- 
 cap on one, and ordering another under my great 
 chair, only excited mirth in the school ; which the 
 very delinquents themselves often increased by 
 loud peals of laughter. Going one frosty morning, 
 into my school, I found one of the larger boys 
 sitting by the fire in my arn&amp;gt;chair. I gently re 
 quested him to remove. He replied that he would, 
 when he had warmed himself : &quot; father finds 
 wood, and not you.&quot; To have my throne usurp 
 ed, in the face of the whole school, shock my gov

 ernment to the centre. I immediately snatched 
 my two-foot rule, and laid it pretty smartly across 
 his back. He quitted the chair, muttering that he 
 would tell father. I found his threats of more 
 consequence than I apprehended. The same af 
 ternoon, a tall raw-boned man called me to the 
 door : immediately collaring me with one hand, 
 and holding a cart-whip over my head with the 
 other, with fury in his face, he vowed he would 
 whip the skin from my bones if ever I struck Jo* 
 tham again : ay, he would do it that very moment, 
 if he was not afraid I would take the law of him. 
 This was the only instance of the overwhelming 
 gratitude of parents I received. The next day it 
 was reported all over town what a cruel man the 
 master was. &quot; Poor Jotham came into school, 
 half frozen and near fainting ; master had been 
 *itting a whole hour by the warm fire ; he only 
 begged him to let him warm himself a little, 
 when the master rose in a rage, and cut open his 
 head with the tongs, and his life was despair 
 ed of.&quot; 
 
 Fatigued with the vexations of my school, I 
 one evening repaired to the tavern, and mixed 
 with some of the young men of the town. Their 
 conversation I could not relish ; mine they could 
 not comprehend. The subject of race-horses be 
 ing introduced, I ventured to descant upon Xan- 
 thus, the immortal courser of Achilles. They 
 had never heard of squire Achilles or his horse ; 
 but they offered to bet two to one that Bajazet, 
 the Old Roan, or the deacon s mare, Pumpkin 
 and Milk, would beat him, and challenged me t&amp;lt;? 
 appoint time and place*

 Nor was I more acceptable among the young 
 women. Being invited to spend an evening, after 
 a quilting, I thought this a happy opportunity 
 to introduce Andromache, the wife of the great 
 Hector, at her loom ; and Penelope, the faithful 
 wife of Ulysses, weaving her seven years web. 
 This was received with a stupid stare, until I 
 mentioned the long time the queen of Ulysses 
 was weaving ; when a smart young woman de 
 served, that she supposed miss Penelope s yarn 
 was rotten in whitening, that made her so long : 
 and then told a tedious story of a piece of cotton 
 and linen she had herself woven, under the same 
 circumstances. She had no sooner finished, than, 
 to enforce my observations, I recited above forty 
 lines of Greek from the Odyssey, and then be 
 gan a dissertation on the ccesura. In the midst of 
 my harangue, a florid-faced young man at the 
 further end of the room, with two large promi 
 nent foreteeth, remarkably white, began to sing, 
 
 &quot; Fire upon the mountains ! run, boys, run . &quot; 
 
 and immediately the whole company rushed for 
 ward to see who should get a chance in the reel 
 of six. 
 
 I was about retiring, fatigued and disgusted, 
 when it was hinted to me, that I might wait on 
 miss Mima home ; but as I could recollect no 
 word in the Greek which would construe into 
 bundling, or any of Homer s heroes who got the 
 bag, I declined. In the Latin, it is true, that ^Ene 
 as and Dido, in the cave, seem something like a

 the next day, that master was a papisk, as he had 
 talked French two hours. 
 
 Disappointed of recreation among the young, 
 my next object was the minister. Here I expec 
 ted pleasure and profit. He had spent many years 
 in preaching for the edification of private fami 
 lies, and was settled in the town in a fit of enthu 
 siasm ; when the people drove away a clergyman, 
 respectable for his years and learning. This he 
 was pleased to call an awakening. He lectured 
 me at the first onset for not attending the confe 
 rence and night meetings ; talked much of gifts, 
 and decried human learning as carnal and devilish ; 
 and well he might, he certainly was under no ob 
 ligations to it; for a new singing master coming 
 into town, the young people, by their master s ad 
 vice, were for introducing Dr. Watts s version of 
 the Psaims. Although I argued with the minister 
 an hour, he remains firmly convinced to this day, 
 that the version of Sternhold and Hopkins is the 
 same in language, letter, and metre, with those 
 psalms king David chanted in the city of Jerusa 
 lem. 
 
 As for the independence I had founded on my 
 friges, it vanished like the rest of my scholastic 
 prospects. I had contracted some debts. My re 
 quest for present payment was received with as 
 tonishment. I found I was not to expect it until 
 the next autumn, and then not in cash, but pro 
 duce ; to become my own collector, and pick up 
 my dues, half a peck of corn or rye in a place. 
 ,. I was almost distracted, and yearned for the ex 
 pi ration of my contract* when an unexpected pe~ 
 : od was put to my distress. News \vas brought,

 that, by the carelessness of the boys, the school- 
 house was burrit down. The common cry now 
 was, that I ought in justice to pay for it, as to my 
 want of proper government the carelessness of the 
 boys ought to be imputed. The beating of Jo- 
 tbam was forgotten, and a thousand stories of my 
 want of proper spirit circulated. These reports, 
 and even the loss of a valuable Gradus ad Parnas- 
 sum, did not damp my joy. I am sometimes led 
 to believe, that my emancipation from real slavery 
 in Algiers did not afford me sincerer joy than I 
 experienced at that moment. 
 
 I returned to rny father, who received me with 
 kindness. My mother heard the story of my dis 
 comfitures with transport ; as she said she had no 
 doubt that her dream about my falling into tLe 
 hands of savages was now out.

 I had played him the preceding season, as the

 of the putrefied heifer with triumph ; as he had rea&quot;d 
 in the news-papers, that playing with paper kites 
 was the foundation of doctor Franklin s fame ; that 
 .John Locke, who dissected the human mind, and 
 discovered the circulation of the soul, had, in the 
 full exercise of his understanding, played at duck 
 and drake on the Thames with his gold watch, 
 while he gravely returned the pebble-stone which 
 he held in his other hand into his fob ; and that 
 the learned sir Isaac Newton made soap bladders 
 with the funk of a tobacco pipe, and was ever af

 use of the delicate finger of a young lady he court

 I was allowed the choice of my profession, to

 The Author commences the Study of Physic with &

 ical Detail of the Operation of Couching for 
 the Gutta Serena, by his Preceptor, upon a young 
 Man born blind. 
 
 THE next spring I entered upon my studies with 
 a physician, not more justly celebrated for his 
 knowledge of the materia medica, than for his pe 
 culiar dexterity and success in couching for the 
 gutta serena, and restoring persons, even born 
 blind, to sight. The account of a cure he per 
 formed, after I had been with him about a year, 
 may not be unacceptable to the lovers of natural 
 research. The subject was a young man of twen 
 ty-two years of age, of a sweet disposition, ami 
 able manners, and opulent connexions. He was 
 born stone blind, j-is blindness was in some 
 measure compensated by the attention of his 
 friends, and the increased power of his other or 
 gans of perception. His brothers and sisters en

 riched his mind by reading to him, in succession, 
 two hours every day, from the best authors. His 
 sense of feeling was astonishingly delicate, and his 
 hearing, if possible, more acute. His senses of 
 taste and smelling were not so remarkable. After 
 the customary salutation of shaking hands with a 
 stranger, he would know a person by the touch of 
 the same hand several years after, though absent 
 in the interim. He could read a book or news 
 paper, newly printed, tolerably well, by tracing, 
 with the tip of his finger, the indents of the types. 
 He acquired a knowledge of the letters of the 
 alphabet early from the prominent letters on the 
 gingerbread alphabets of the baker. He was 
 master of music, and had contrived a board, perfo* 
 rated with many gimblet holes, and with the assist 
 ance of a little bag of wooden pegs, shaped at 
 top according to his directions, he could prick al 
 most any tune, upon its being sung to him. When 
 in a large company, who sat silent, he could dis 
 tinguish how many persons were present, by not 
 ing, with his ear, their different manner of breath^ 
 ing. By the rarity or density of the air, not per 
 ceivable by those in company, he could distinguish 
 high ground from low ; and by the motion of the 
 summer s breeze, too small to move the loftiest leaf, 
 he would pronounce whether he was in a wood or 
 open country. 
 
 He was an unfeigned believer in the salutary 
 truths of Christianity. He had imbibed its bene 
 volent spirit. When he spoke of religion, his .lan 
 guage was love to God, and good will to man. 
 He was no zealot, but when he talked of the won 
 ders of creation, he was animated with a glow of

 enthusiasm. You observed, the other day, as we 
 were walking on this plain, my friend addressing 
 himself to me, as I was intimate in the family, 
 that you knew a certain person by his gait, when 
 at so great a distance that you could not discern 
 his features. From this you took occasion to ob- 
 seive, that you saw the master-hand of the great 
 Creator in the obvious difference that was between 
 man and man : not only the grosser difference be 
 tween the Indian, the African, the Esquimeaux, 
 #nd the white man ; but that which distinguishes 
 and defines accurately men of the same nation, 
 and even children of the same parents. You ob 
 served, that as all the children of the great family 
 of the earth were compounded of similar mem 
 bers, features, and lineaments, how wonderfully 
 it displayed the skill of the Almighty Artist to 
 model such an infinite variety of beings, and dis 
 tinctly diversify them, from the same materials. 
 You added, that the incident you had noticed gave 
 fresh instance of admiration ; for you was now 
 convinced that if even all men had been formed 
 of so near resemblance as not to be discerned from 
 each other when at rest, yet when in motion, from 
 their gait, air, and manner, they might readily be 
 distinguished. While you spoke, I could perceive 
 that you pitied me as being blind to a wonderful 
 operation of creative power. I too, in my turn, 
 could triumph. J31ind as I am, I have discovered 
 a still minuter, but as certain a distinction between 
 the children of men, which has escaped the touch 
 of your eyes. Bring me five men, perfect stran 
 gers to me ; pair the nails of the same finger so 
 as to be even with the fingers ends ; let me touch,

 with the tip of my finger, the nails thus prepared : 
 tell me each person s name as he passes in contact 
 before me ; bring the same persons to me one 
 month afterwards with their nails paired in the 
 same manner, and I will call every one by his 
 right name. For be assured, my friend, that Art 
 ist who has denied to me that thing called light, 
 hath opened the eyes of my mind, to know that 
 there is not a greater difference between the Afri 
 can and the European, than what 1 could discov 
 er between the finger-nails of all the men of this 
 world. This experiment he afterwards tried with 
 uniform success. It was amusing, in a gayer hour, 
 to hear him argue the superiority of the touch to 
 the sight. Certainly, the feeling is a nobler sense 
 than that you call sight. 1 inter it from the care 
 nature has taken of the former, and her disregard 
 to the latter. The eyes are comparatively poor, 
 puny, weak organs. A small blow, a mote, or a 
 straw, may reduce those who see with them to a 
 situation as pitiable as mine, while feeling is dif 
 fused over the whole body. Cut off my arm, and 
 a sense of feeling remains. Completely dismem 
 ber me, and while I live I possess it. It is co 
 existent with life itself. 
 
 The senses of smelling and taste are but mod 
 ifications of this noble sense, distinguished, through 
 the inaccuracy of men, by other names. The fla 
 vour of the most delicious morsel is felt by the 
 tongue ; and, when we smell the aromatic, it is 
 the- effluvia of the rose which comes in contact 
 with the olfactory nerves. You that enjoy sight 
 inadvertently confess its inferiority. My brother, 
 honing his penknife the other day, passed it over

 bis thumb nail to discover if the edge was smooth. 
 I heard him, and inquired why he did not touch 
 it with his eyes, as he did other objects. He con 
 fessed that he could not discover the gaps by the 
 sight. Here the superiority of the most inaccu 
 rate seat of the feeling was manifest. To con 
 clude, he would archly add in marriage, the 
 most important concern in life, how many misera 
 ble of both sexes, are left to deplore in tears their 
 dependance on this treacherous thing called sight. 
 From this danger I am happily secured, contin 
 ued he smiling and pressing the hand of his cous 
 in who sat beside him a beautiful blooming 
 young woman of eighteen, who had been bred 
 with him from childhood, and whose affection for 
 him was such, that she was willing, notwithstand 
 ing his blindness, to take him as a partner for 
 life. They expected shortly to be married. Not 
 withstanding his accuracy and veracity upon sub 
 jects he could comprehend, there were many on 
 which he was miserably confused. He called 
 sight the touch of the eyes. He had no adequate 
 idea of colours. White, he supposed, was like 
 the feeling of down ; and scarlet he resembled to 
 the sound of martial music. By passing his hand* 
 over the porcelain, earthern, or plaster of Paris 
 images, he could readily conceive that they were 
 representations of men or animals. But he could 
 have no idea of pictures. I presented him a large 
 picture of his grandfather, painted with oil-colours 
 on canvass ; told him whose resemblance it was ; 
 he passed his hand over the smooth surface and 
 mused : he repeated this, exclaimed it was won

 Upon this young man, my preceptor operated 
 successfully. 1 was present during the whole pro 
 cess, though few were admitted. Upon the intro 
 duction of the couching instrument, and the remo 
 val of the film from the retina, he appeared con 
 fused. When the operation was completed, and 
 he was permitted to look around him, he was vi 
 olently agitated. The irritability of the ophthal 
 mic muscles faintly expressed the perturbation of 
 his mind. After two-and-twenty years of total 
 darkness, to be thus awakened to a new world of 
 sensation and light, to have such a flood of day 
 poured on his benighted eye-balls, overwhelmed 
 him : the infant sight was too weak for the shock, 
 and he fainted. The doctor immediately inter 
 cepted the light with the proper bandages, and, by 
 the application of volatiles, he was revived. The 
 next day the dressings were removed : he had for 
 tified his mind and was more calm. At first he 
 appeared to have lost more than he had gained 
 by being restored to vision. When blind, he 
 could walk tolerably well in places familiar to him. 
 From sight, he collected no ideas of distance. 
 Green was a colour peculiarly agreeable to the 
 new-born sight. Being led to a window, he was 
 charmed with a tree in full verdure, and extended 
 his arms to touch it, though at ten rods distance. 
 To distinguish objects within reach, he would close 
 his eyes, feel for them with his hands, and then 
 look earnestly upon them. 
 
 According to a preconcerted plan, the third day 
 fijs bandages were removed, in the presence of hie.

 parents, brothers, sisters, friends, and of the ami 
 able lovely girl to whom he was shortly to be mar 
 ried. By his request, a profound silence was to 
 be observed, while he endeavoured to discover the 
 person of her who was the object of his dearest 
 affection. It was an interesting scene. The com 
 pany obeyed his injunction. Not a finger moved, 
 or a breath aspirated. The bandage was then re 
 moved ; and when he had recovered from the con 
 fusion of the instant effusion of light, he passed 
 his eye hastily over the whole group. His sensa 
 tions were novel and interesting. It was a mo 
 ment of importance : for aught he knew, he might 
 find the bosom partner of his future life, the twin 
 soul of his affection, in the fat scullion wench of 
 his father s kitchen, or in the person of the tooth 
 less, palsied, decripit nurse, who held the bason 
 of gruel at his elbow. 
 
 In passing his. eye a second time over the circle, 
 his attention was arrested by his beloved cousin. 
 The agitations of her lovely features, and the 
 evanescent blush on her cheek, would have at 
 once betrayed her to a more experienced eye. 
 He passed his eye to the next person, and imme 
 diately returned it to her. It was a moment big 
 with expectation. Many a finger was raised to 
 the lips of the spectators, and many a look expres 
 sive of the silence she should preserve was cast 
 towards her. But the conflict was too violent for 
 her delicate frame. He looked more intensely ; 
 she burst into tears, and spoke. At the well known 
 voice he closed his eyes, rushed towards her, and 
 clasped her i\i his arms. I envied them their feel 
 ings ; but I thought then, pd do now, that the

 sensations of my preceptor, the skilful humane 
 operator were more enviable. The man who 
 could restore life and usefulness to the darling of 
 his friends, and scatter light in the paths of an 
 amiable young pair, must have known a joy nev 
 er surpassed ; except, with reverence be it spoken, 
 by the satisfaction of our benevolent Saviour, 
 when, by his miraculous power, he opened the 
 eyes of the actually blind, made the dumb to sing, 
 and the lame and impotent leap for joy.

 i man of his acknowledged learning should not 
 sometimes quote Greek. Of my acquirements in 
 that language I was still proud. I attribute the 
 indifference with which it was received in the 
 town where I had kept school to the rusticity and 
 ignorance of the people. As I now moved in the 
 circles of polished life, I ventured sometimes, when 
 the young ladies had such monstrous colds as that 
 they could not by the earnest persuasions of the 
 company be prevailed on to sing, and when it had 
 been frequently observed that it was quaker meet 
 ing, to spout a few lines from the Iliad. It is true 
 they did not interrupt me with 
 
 &quot; Fire upon the mountains ! run, boys, run !&quot; 
 
 but the most sonorous lines of the divine blind bard 
 were received with cold approbation of politeness. 
 One young lady alone seemed pleased. She would 
 frequently ask me to repeat those lines of VVabash 
 poetry ; though once, in the sublime passage of the 
 hero Ulysses hanging fifty young maidens with his 
 own hands, in the Odyssey, I heard the term pe 
 dant pronounced with peculiar emphasis by a beau 
 at my back. If I had taken the hint, and passed my 
 Greek upon my companions for Indian, they would 
 have heard me with rapture. I have since known 
 that worthy indefatigable missionary to the Indians,

 with speeches in the aboriginal language of Amer

 my first essay in metre in an ode addressed to her

 and scattered them with profusion through my ode. 
 I praised her golden locks, and assimilated her 
 to the ox-eyed Juno ; sent her a correct copy, and 
 dispersed a number of others among her friends. I 
 afterwards found, that what I intended as the sub- 
 limest panegyric was received as cutting insult, 
 The golden tresses, and the ox-eyed epithet, the 
 most favourite passages in my poem, were very un 
 fortunate ; as the young lady was remarkable for 
 very prominent eyes, which resembled what, in 
 horses are called wall-eyes. Her hair was what 
 is vulgarly called carroty ; its unfashionable col

 inquired for Mr. Updike Underbill. Upon being 
 informed that I was the person, with two of the 
 most profound bows I had ever seen, he advanced 
 towards me, and, with slow and solemn emphasis, 
 said, &quot; Then, sir, I have the honour to present you 
 
 with a billet from my friend, Mr. Jasper T ,&quot; 
 
 and bowed twice, as stately and low as before. I 
 took the letter, which was as big as a government 
 packet ; and, in the midst of a large folio sheet, 
 
 read the following letter, from Mr. Jasper T , 
 
 a professed admirer of the young lady to whom I 
 had addressed my ode after the manner of the

 Though I was engaged to watch that night with 
 one of my preceptor s customers, yet, as Mr. Jas 
 per T seemed so friendly and civil, I could 
 
 not find it in my heart to refuse him, and replied, 
 that I would, with pleasure, wait upon the gentle 
 man. &quot; Sir,&quot; resumed the bearer, &quot; you are a 
 man of honour, every inch of you, and I am your 
 most obedient, most obsequious, and most humblp 
 servant :&quot; and then, making two profound bows 
 in the shop, and one more at the door, he retired, 
 He was no sooner departed, than I sat down to re- 
 peruse this elegant and very extraordinary billet. 
 I had no particular acquaintance with Mr. Jasper 
 T -, and why he should write to me at all puz 
 zled me. The first part of the letter, I doubted 
 not, contained an approbation of my ode, and a 
 request to be indulged with an explanation of 
 some of its peculiar beauties. I began to recol 
 lect illustrations and parodies from some favourite 
 passages in the s lliad. But what we were to do in 
 wasting a few charges of powder was utterly inex 
 plicable. At one time, indeed, I thought it an 
 invitation to shoot partridges, and bethought my 
 self of scouring a long-barrelled gun, which had 
 descended like an heir, loom in our family ; and 
 had perhaps killed Indians on Long Island, in 
 the hands of my brave ancestor, captain John 
 Underbill. Then again I reflected, that the low- 
 er end of a wharf, in a populous town, was not 
 the most prjfcable place to spring a covey of par 
 tridges. But what puzzled me most was his punc 
 tual attention to hours, and even seconds. My 
 doubts were all clearejl by the entrance of a fellow 
 to whom I communicated the letter. He

 Mr. Jasper T - with sword and pistol.&quot; &quot; Pho !&quot; 
 replied I, &quot; you banter. Do look at the conclusion 
 of the letter. Will you make me believe that any 
 man in his senses would conclude with all these 
 expressions of esteem and friendship an invita- 
 tion to give him an opportunity of cutting my 
 throat, or blowing my brains out ?&quot; &quot; You have 
 been bred in yankee land,&quot; replied my fellow- 
 student. &quot; Men of honour are above the common 
 rules of propriety and common sense. This letter, 
 which is a challenge, bating some little inaccura 
 cies of grammar and spelling, in substance, I assure 
 you, would not disgrace a man of the highest hon 
 our ; and, if Mr. Jasper T acts as much the 
 
 man of honour on the wharf as he has on paper, he 
 will preserve the same style of good breeding and 
 politeness there also. While, with one hand, he 
 with a deadly longe, passes his sword through 
 your lungs, he will take his hat off with the other, 
 and bow gracefully to your corps.&quot; &quot; Lord de

 :r^st instruct you. There is no more danger in 
 these town duels than in pounding our great mortar. 
 Why, I fought three duels myself in Carolina be 
 fore I was seventeen years old ; and one was for 
 an affront offered to the negro wench who suckled 
 me : and I declare 1 had rather fight ten more, 
 than pass once, in a stage waggon, over Horse 
 Neck. 1 see your antagonist has offered you to 
 bring a second. I will go with you. When you 
 arrive on the ground, we seconds shall mark out 
 your position to stand in ; and to be sure, as in 
 case of bloodshed we shall come into difficulty, 
 we shall place you at a pretty respectable distance. 
 You will then turn a copper for the first fire ; 
 but I should advise you to grant it to him. This 
 will give him a vast idea ot your firmness and con 
 tempt of danger. Your antagonist, with banish 
 ment from his country, and the gallows staring 
 him in the face, will be sure not to hit you, on 
 his own accouht. The ball will pass at least ten 
 rods over your head. You must then discharge 
 your pistol in the air, and offer him to fire again , 
 as, in the language of the duellist, you will have 
 given him hisliie, so it will be highly inconsistent 
 in him to again attemp^vours.. We seconds shall 
 immediately interfere, and pronounce you both 
 men of honour. The matter jn controversy will 
 be passed over ; you will shake hands, commence 
 warm friends, and the ladies will adore you.

 value your reputation on change. When he has 
 fired over your head, you may confess what you 
 please with honour ; but, however inoffensive 
 you may have been, if you make such a confession 
 before, you are a man of no honour. You will be 
 posted in the coffee-house for a coward.&quot; Not 
 withstanding the comfortable address of my friend, 
 the thoughts of a premature death, or being crip 
 pled for life, distressed me. Nor was the fear 
 of killing my antagonist, and of what my poor 
 parents would suffer from my being exposed to in 
 famous punishment, less alarming. 1 passed some 
 hours of dreadful anxiety ; when I was relieved 
 from my distress in a way I little apprehended. 
 My challenger, who had lived some years in 
 town as a merchant s clerk, viewing me as a raw 
 lad from the country that would never dare accept 
 his challenge, when his messenger returned \|as 
 petrified with astonishment. When assured that I 
 had excepted his challenge as a man of courage 
 and honour, his heart died within him. His friend 
 had no sooner gone to prepare the pistols, than, 
 by communicating the business as a great secret 
 to two or three female friends, the intended duel 
 was noised about town. XJie justices, select-men, 
 and grand-jurors, convened. Warrants were is 
 sued, and constables dispatched into all quarters.

 would drop an affair which we had neither of us 
 any heart to pursue. My acceptance of the chal

 ine pedant ; and I verily believe that, if I had

 IN the circle of my acquaintance there was a young 
 lady, of not the most promising person, and of rath 
 er a vinegar aspect, who was approximating to 
 wards thirty years of age ; though, by avoiding 
 married parties, mingling with very young com 
 pany, dressing airily, shivering in lawn and sarce 
 net at the meeting house in December, affecting a 
 girlish lisp, blush, and giggle, she was still endea 
 vouring to ward off that invidious appellation of 
 old maid. Upon good grounds I am led to believe 
 &quot;hat the charity of the tea-table had added to her 
 ; because, from a long acquaintance with

 her, I could never induce her to remember any 
 event, however trivial, which happened before 
 Lexington battle. The girls of my age respect 
 ed me as a man of spirit ; but 1 was more fond of 
 being esteemed as a man of learning. This young 
 lady loved literature, and lamented to me her ig 
 norance of the Greek. I gave her a decided pre 
 ference to her rivals. SJie borrowed books of me, 
 and read them with astonishing rapidity. From 
 my own little library, and from those of my friends, 
 I procured about sixty volumes for her ; among 
 which were Locke on Human Understanding, 
 Stackhcuse s Body of Divinity, and Glass s works, 
 not on cookery, but the benignant works of John 
 Glass, the father of Sandimari and the Sandiman- 
 ians ; in my collection, I did not however omit 
 Pope s Homer, and Dryden s \ r irgil ; and, to my 
 astonishment, though I knew that her afternoons 
 were devoted to the structure of caps and bonnets, 
 she perused those sixty volumes completely, and 
 returned them to me in less than a month. There 
 was one thing peculiarly pleasing to me, as a man 
 of letters, that she never made dog-leaves, or soiled 
 the books ; a slovenly practice, of which even 
 great scholars are sometimes guilty. I would, at 
 times, endeavour to draw her into a conversation 
 upon the authors she had recently perused : she 
 would blush, look down, and say that it did not 
 become a young girl, like her, to talk upon such 
 subjects with a gentleman of my sense. The com 
 pliment it contained ever rendered the apology 
 irresistible. One day she asked me to lend her a 
 dictionary. I immediately procured for her the 
 great doctor Johnson s in two volumes loll.?.

 About three days afterwards she offered to return 
 them. Knowing that a dictionary was a work to 
 which reference was often necessary, and thinking 
 it might be of some service, even to a lady of her 
 learning, I pressed her to keep it longer : when she 
 replied, with the prettiest lisp imaginable, that 
 they were indeed very pretty story-books ; but, 
 since I had lent them to her, she had read them all 
 through twice ; and then inquired, .with the same 
 gentle lisp, if I could not lend her a book called 
 Rolling Belly Lettres. I was in absolute astonish 
 ment. Virgil s traveller, treading on the snake in 
 the grass, was comparatively in perfect compo 
 sure. I took a folio under each arm, and skipped 
 out of the house, as lightly as if I had had nothing 
 heavier than a late antifederal election sermon to 
 carry. This learned young lady was amazingly 
 affronted at my abrupt departure ; but, when the 
 cause of it was explained to her, some months af 
 ter, she endeavdured to persuade a journeyman 
 tailor, who courted her niece, to challenge me to 
 fight a duel : he actually penned a challenge up 
 on one of his master s pasteboard patterns ; and I 
 verily believe would have sent it by his second, 
 if he had not been informed that my character 
 was established as a man of hoceur.

 careless Readers. 
 
 BISGUSTED with the frivolity of the young and the 
 deceit of the antiquated ladies, I no\v applied my 
 self sedulously to my studies. Cullen, Munroe, 
 Boerhaave, and Hunter, were my constant com 
 panions. As I advanced in valuable science, my 
 admiration of the Greek declined. I now found 
 that Machaon and Podalirious, the surgeons of Ho 
 mer, were mere quacks, ignorant of even the appli 
 cation of plasters, or the eighteen-tailed bandage ; 
 and, in botany, inferior to the Indian Powwows ; 
 and that the green ointment of my learned friend 
 doctor Kitteridge would have immortalized a bone- 
 setter in the Grecian era, and transmitted him with 
 Esculapius to a seat among the gods- In justice 
 to that venerable language, and to the learned pro 
 fessors of Cambridge, Yale, and Dartmouth, I will 
 candidly confess, that my knowledge of it was now 
 in the first year of my apprenticeship of some ser 
 vice to me, in now and then finding the root of the 
 labels cyphered on our gallipots. I shall mention 
 a little incident which happened about this time, 
 as it contains a lesson valuable to the reader, if ht

 has penetration enough to discover it, and candour 
 enough to apply it to himself. Though I applied 
 myself closely to my books, yet, as hours of re 
 laxation were recommended by my preceptor, I 
 sometimes indulged in the dance, and in sleighing 
 rides. The latter being once proposed to me, at a 
 time when I was without the means of paying my 
 club, I had retired with discontent to my ehamber 5 
 where I accidentally cast my eyes upon a little 
 old-fashioned duodecirna Bible, with silver clasps, 
 in the corner of my trunk a present from my mo 
 ther at parting, who had recommended the frequent 
 perusal of it, as my guide in difficulty, and con 
 solation in distress. Young people in perplexity 
 always think of home. The Bible reproached me. 
 To remove the uneasy sensation, and for the want 
 of something more agreeable to do, I took up the 
 neglected book. No sooner had I unclasped it, 
 than a guinea dropt from the leaves, which had 
 been deposited there by the generous care of my 
 affectionate mother ; and, by my inexcusable in 
 attention, had lain there undiscovered for more than 
 two years. I hastily snatched the brilliant prize, 
 joined my young companions, and resolved that, in 
 gratitude, 1 would read a chapter in the Bible eve 
 ry remaining day of my life. This resolution I then 
 persevered in a whole fortnight., Whilst I am on 
 this subject, I will observe, thotJgh no zealot, I 
 have since, in the hours of misery and poverty, 
 with which the reader shall be acquainted in the 
 sequel, drawn treasures of support and consolation 
 from that blessed book, more precious than the 
 gems of Golconda, or the gold of Ophir.

 shagreen case of pocket surgical instruments. As 
 it is possible that some friend of his may peruse 
 this work, suffer me to pay him a little tribute of 
 gratitude. He was an unaffected gentleman, and 
 a man of liberal science. In him were united the 
 acute chymist, the accurate botanist, the skilful 
 operator, and profound physician. He possessed 
 all the essence, without the parade of learning. 
 In the most simple language, he would trace the 
 latent disease to its diagnostic ; and, from his lips. 
 subjects the most abstruse were rendered familiar 
 to the unlettered man. Excepting when he was 
 with his pupils, or men of science, I never heard 
 him use a technical term. He observed once, that 
 the bold truth of Paracelsus delighted him, but it 
 partook so much of the speech of our country prac- 
 titioners, that he was disgusted with the pomposity 
 of Theophrastus Bombastus. He was both an in 
 structor and parent to his pupils an instructor ia 
 all the depth of science he possessed, and a tender 
 parent in directing them in the paths of virtue and 
 s. May he long live to bless bis country

 by the peculiar politeness and urbanity of the then

 to my surprise, I found the curiosities of all coun

 of the rude arts, arms and antiquities of the ori

 The Author mounteth his Nag, and setteth out full

 Country Practitioner. 
 
 IN the autumn of 1785 I returned to my parents, 
 who received me with rapture. My father had 
 reared for me a likely pie- bald mare. Our sad 
 dler equipped me with horse furniture, not forget 
 ting the little saddle-bags, which T richly replen 
 ished with drugs purchased at Boston. With a 
 few books, and my surgeon s instruments in my 
 portmanteau, and a few dollars in my pocket, I sat 
 out, with a light heart, to seek practice, fame, 
 and fortune, as a country practitioner. 
 
 My primary object was to obtain a place of 
 settlement. This 1 imagined an easy task, from 
 my own acquirements and the celebrity of my 
 preceptor. My first stop was at a new township, 
 yet tolerably well stocked with a hardy laborious

 set of inhabitants. Five physicians of eminence 
 had within a few years attempted a settlement in 
 this place. The first fell a sacrifice to strong li 
 quor ; the second put his trust in horses, and was 
 ruined by the loss of a valuable sire ; the third 
 quarrelled with the midwife, and was obliged to 
 remove ; the fourth, having prescribed rather un 
 luckily for a young woman of his acquaintance, 
 grievously afflicted with a tympany, went to the 
 Ohio ; and the last, being a prudent man, who 
 sold his books and instruments for wild land, and 
 raised his own crop of medicine, was actually in 
 the way of making a great fortune ; for, in only 
 ten year s practice, he left at his decease, an es 
 tate both real and personal, which was appraised 
 at one hundred pounds, lawful money. This ac 
 count was not likely to engage the attention of a 
 young man upon whose education twice the sum 
 had been expended. 
 
 In the next town I was assured I might do well 
 as a physician, if I would keep a grog-shop, or let 
 myself as a labourer in the hay season, and keep 
 a school in the winter. The first part of the pro 
 position 1 heard with patience ; but, at the bare 
 mention of a school, I fled the ttywn abruptly. In 
 the neighbouring town they did not want a phy 
 sician,, as an experienced itinerant doctor visited 
 the place every March, when the people had most 
 leisure to be sick and take physic. He practiced 
 with great success, especially in slow consump 
 tions, charged very low, and took his pay in any 
 ihing and every thing. Besides, he carried a 
 mould with him, to run pewter spoons, and was 
 equally good at mending a kettle and a constilu^

 AT length I fixed my residence in a town where 
 four physicians were already in full practice, of 
 such contrariety in theory, that I never knew any 
 two of them agree in any practice but in abus 
 ing me and decrying my skill. It was however 
 four months before I had any practice, except the 
 extracting of a tooth from a corn-fed girl, who 
 spun at my lodgings, and who used to look wist 
 fully at me, and ask, if the doctorer did not think 
 the tooth-ache a sign of love ? and say she felt 
 dreadfully all over : and the application of a

 trade, at length drawn the attention of the people 
 towards me. 
 
 I had now some opportunity of increasing my 
 information, by inspecting the practice of my sen 
 iors. The principal physician had been regular 
 ly educated : as I ha^ been so likewise, he affec 
 ted to pay me some attention on purpose to mor 
 tify those three quacks, who, he said, had picked 
 tip their knowledge, as they did their medicine, 
 by the way-side. He was a very formal man in 
 manners and practice,. He thought fresh air high 
 ly noxious in all diseases. I once visited a patient 
 of his, in dog-days, whose parched tongue and 
 acrid skin denoted a violent fever. I was almost 
 suffocated upon entering the room. The windows 
 were closed, and the cracks stuffed with tow ; the 
 curtains were drawn close round the patient s bed, 
 which was covered with a rug, and three comfort 
 able blankets ; a large fire was made in the room ; 
 the door listed, and the key-hole stopped ; while 
 the doctor gravely administered irritating stimu 
 lants to allay the. fever. He carried a favourite 
 practical author in his bags ; and after rinding the 
 patient s case in the index, pulled out a pair of 
 money scales, and with the utmost nicety, weigh 
 ed off the prescribed dose to the decimal of a dram. 
 He told me, as a great secret, that about thirteen 
 years and one day past, he had nearly destroyed 
 a patient, by administering half a dram of pill 
 cochia more than was prescribed in the books. He 
 was called the learned doctor. 
 
 The practice of the second town physician was 
 directly opposite. He prescribed large doses of 
 the most powerful drugs. If he had been inclin- 
 


## p. 67 (#71) ##############################################

 ed to weigh his medicine, I believe it would have 
 been with gross weight rather than troy. He was 
 an untaught disciple of the English Ratcliffe, care 
 less, daring, and often succesful. He was admira 
 ble in nervous cases, rose cancers, and white swel 
 lings. Upon the first symptoms of these stubborn 
 disorders, he would drive them, and the subjects 
 of them to a state of quiescence. He was called 
 the cheap doctor ; because he always speedily 
 cured or killed. 
 
 The third physician dealt altogether in simples. 
 The only compound he ever gave, or took, was 
 buttered flip for a cough. It was said, that, if 
 he did no good, he never did any harm. He was 
 called the safe doctor. 
 
 The fourth physician was not celebrated for be 
 ing learned, safe or cheap ; but he had more prac 
 tice than all the other three together, for he was a 
 musical* man, &nd well gifted in prayer.

 even the same pretensions as the crowned heads of 
 Europe have to their wisdom, power, and great 
 ness. He derived it from his birth ; for he was 
 the seventh son of a seventh son, and his mother 
 was a doctress. He did not indeed bear the name 
 or rank, but I number him with the learned ; as 
 he was sometimes called to visit a patient at that 
 critical interesting period, when the other physi 
 cians had given him over ; but his ordinary prac 
 tice lay wholly among sheep, horses, and cattle. 
 He also could boast of astonishing success, and 
 was as proud and opinionated as the best of them ; 
 and, fo/ aught I know, it was as instructive to hear 
 him talk of his ring-bones, wind-galls, and spavins, 
 as to hear our first physician descant upon his 
 paroxysms and peripneumony. 
 
 Being sent for one day to attend a man whose 
 leg was said to be broken by a fall from a frame at 
 a raising, I found, upon my arrival at the patient s, 
 that a brother of the faculty, from the vicinity, had 
 arrived before me, and completed the operation. 
 He was celebrated for his skill in desperate cases ; 
 and universally allowed to be a man of learning. 
 He had prescribed^ gill of burnt brandy, with a 
 pepper-pod in it, to keep # up the patient s spirits 
 under the operation, andl^ook another himself, 
 to keep his hand steady. He splintered the frac 
 tured limb with the bone of two pair of old-fashion 
 ed stays he had caused to be ript to pieces, and 
 bound round the leg with all the garters in the 
 neighbourhood. He bowed gracefully as I enter 
 ed, and regretted extremely that he had not my 
 assistance in setting the bones ; and, with a loud 
 voice, and the most unparalleled assurance, began

 to lay the case before me, and amplify the oper 
 ation he had performed. Sir, said he, when I 
 came to view the patient, I had little hopes of 
 saving his life. 1 found the two lesser bones of 
 the leg, the musa and the tristis, shivered into a 
 thousand splinters ; while the larger bone, the 
 ambobus, had happily escaped unhurt. Perceiv 
 ing I could scarce refrain from laughing, and was 
 about to speak, Sir, said he, winking upon me, I 
 perceive you are one of us men of science, and 
 1 wish you to suspend your opinion until a pri 
 vate consultation, lest our conversation may alarm 
 the patient too much, for you know, as the learn 
 ed Galen observes, 
 
 Omne quod exit in Hum, sen Graccurn, give La- 
 tinum, Lsse genus neutvum, sic invariabile nomen- 
 
 By the way, nurse, these learned languages arc 
 apt to make the professors of them very thirsty. 
 While the todd^ was making, he proceeded : 
 When I pondered this perilous, piteous, pertina 
 cious, pestiferous, petrifying case, I immediately 
 thought of the directions of the learned doctors 
 Hudibras and M fc Fingal, not forgetting, as the 
 wound was on the leg, the great Cruikshank s 
 church history. When we had drunk our liquor, 
 of which he took four fifths, by his direction a new 
 mug was made a little stronger, and we retired 
 to our consultation. 
 
 I am much obliged to you, said he, for not 
 discovering my ignorance to these people ; though 
 it is ten to one if I had not rather convinced 
 the block-heads of yours, if you had attempted 
 it. A regular bred physician, sometime since.

 attempted this. He declared, over the sick man r s 
 bed, that I was ignorant and presuming. I repli 
 ed that he was a quack ; and offered to leave our 
 pretensions to knowledge to the company, which 
 consisted of a midwife, two experienced nurses, 
 ane some others, not so eminent for learning. He 
 quoted Cullen and Chesselden ; and I Tully and 
 Virgil : until at length, when 1 had nearly ex 
 hausted my stock of cant phrases, and he was gain 
 ing the attention of our judges, I luckily bethought 
 me of Lilly s Grammar. I began Propria qua3 
 Maribus ; and, before 1 had got twenty lines, the 
 opinion of the audience was apparently in my favor. 
 They judged naturally enough that I was the 
 most learned man, because the most unintelligible. 
 This raised the doctor s ire so much, that, from 
 disputing with me, he turned to berate them for 
 a parcel of fools, sots, and old women, to put their 
 Jives in the hands of such an ignoramus as me. 
 This quickly decided the contest in my favour. 
 The old nurses raised their voices, the midwife 
 her broom-stick, and the whole train of mob-cap 
 ped judges their skinny fists, and we drove him 
 out of the house in triumph. Our victory was 
 so complete, that, in the military style, we did 
 not allow him to remain on the field to bury his 
 dead. 
 
 But it is time to tell you who I am. Sir, I 
 drink your health. In brief, sir, I am the son 
 of a respectable clergyman, received a college 
 education, entered into merchandise, failed, and, 
 by a train of misfortunes, was obliged to com 
 mence doctor, for sustenance. I settled myself 
 in this back country. At first I was applied to

 chiefly in desperate cases ; where no reputation 
 is lost if the patient dies, and much gained if 
 he recovers. I have performed some surprising 
 cures ; but how I cannot tell you, except it was 
 by allowing my patients small beer, or any thing 
 else they hankered after, which I have heard 
 was sometimes efficacious in the crisis of a fever. 
 But talking of drink, sir, I wish your health. I 
 believe I have never injured any persons by my 
 prescriptions, as powdered burnt crust, chalk, 
 and juice of beets and carrots, are rny most pow 
 erful medicines. We can be of mutual service 
 to each other. Nurse, another mug. We doc 
 tors find this a very difficult case. As I have 
 borne down these country quacks by superiour 
 effrontery, I can recommend you to full practice. 
 I will call you to consult with me in difficult 
 cases ; for, as I was saying, sir, 1 wish your, 
 good health, mine are all difficult cases ; and you, 
 in return, shall lend me books, and give me 
 such instructions as will enable me to do good, 
 as well as get fame and bread. The proposal 
 was reasonable. I closed with it. He emptied 
 the third mug, and we returned to our patient. 
 When the dressings were removed, I discovered 
 that there was not the slightest fracture of the fib 
 ula or tibia ; but only a slight contusion on the pat- 
 ula, which would perhaps not have alarmed any 
 other person but our patient, who was a rich old 
 bachelor. I recommended an emmollient, Which 
 my learned brother acquisced in, saying, with his 
 usual air, that it was the very application he in 
 tended, having applied the garters and whalebone

 merely to concoct the tristis, the musa, and the 
 arnbobus, firmly together. 
 
 A young girl, at the door, showed him a wound 
 on her elbow, which she had received in strug 
 gling about red cars at a husking ; which he grave- 
 )y pronounced to be a fistula in ano. This gen 
 tleman is rea ly a man of abilities ; has since 
 made valuable acquirements in the knowledge of 
 the human frame, and the materia medica. If 
 he could be led to substitute the aquatic draughts 
 of doctor Sangrado, as a succedaneum for the dif 
 fusible stimuli of Brown, he would become use* 
 fill in the faculty, and yet see happy days. 
 
 The doctor kept his word He read my books, 
 received my instructions, and recommended me to 
 his patients. But as I copied my preceptor, in 
 the simplicity of my language I never attempted 
 to excite the fear of my patients, to magnjfy my 
 skill ; and could not reduce three fractured bones 
 in a limb which contained but two. My advice 
 was little attended to, except when backed with 
 that of my pupil, accompanied with frequent quo 
 tations from Lilly. He obtained all the credit of 
 our success ; and the people generally supposed 
 me a young man of moderate talents, whom the 
 learned doctor might make something of in a 
 course of years.

 Jl Medical Consultation. 
 
 A MERRY incident gave,me a perfect insight into the 
 practice of the several physicians I have just eu 
 logised. A drunken jockey, having fallen from 
 his horse at a public review, was taken up sense 
 less, and extended upon the long table of the tav 
 ern. He soon recovered his breath, and groaned 
 most piteously. As his head struck the ground 
 first, it was apprehended by some, unacquainted 
 with its solidity, that he had fractured his skull. 
 The faculty hastened from all quarters to his as 
 sistance. The learned scrupulous physician, after 
 requesting that the doors and windows might be 
 shut, approached the patient ; and, with a stately 
 air, declined giving his opinion, as he had unfor 
 tunately left at home his 4 Pr ingle on Contusions.* 
 The cheap doctor immediately pronounced the 
 wound a compound fracture, prescribed half a dose 
 of crude opium, and called for the trepanning in 
 struments. The safe doctor proposed brown pa 
 per, dipped in rum and cobwebs, to staunch the 
 blood. The popular physician, the musical doc 
 tor, told Uv a jovial story ; and then suddenly re 
 laxing his features, observed, that he viewed the 
 groaning wretch as a monument of justice : that he

 to be set home upon our minds by prayer. While

 with an audible voice, winking upon me began : 
 The learned doctor NominativoHoc Caput, in his 
 treatise on brains, observes, that the seat of the 
 Houl may be known from the affections of the man. 
 The residence of a wise man s soul is in his ears ; 
 a glutton s in his palate ; a gallant s in his lips ; 
 an old maid s in her tongue ; a dancer s in his 
 toes ; a drunkard s in his throat : By the way, 
 landlord, give us a button of sling. When we 
 learned wish to know if a wound endangers life, 
 we consequently inquire into the affections of the 
 patient, and see if the wound injures the seat of 
 his soul : if that escapes, however deep and ghast 
 ly the wound, we pronounce life in no danger. 
 A horse -jockey s soul gentlemen, I wish your

 was pursuing my studies in the hospitals in Eng 
 land, I once saw seventeen horse -jockies, some ot 
 whom were noblemen, killed by the fall of a scaf 
 fold in Newmarket, and all wounded in the heel. 
 Twenty others, with their arms, backs, and necks 
 broken, survived. I saw one noble jockey, with 
 his nominativo caret, which is Greek for a noble 
 man s head, split entirely open. His brains ran 
 down his face like the white of a broken egg ; but 
 as his heel was unhurt, he survived, and his judg

 some of the spectators were about following his 
 directions, when the other doctors interfered. 
 They had heard him with disdainful impatience, 
 and now each raised his voice to support his par 
 ticular opinion, backed by his adherents. Bring

 they to a consultation of fisty-cuffs. The practi 
 tioner in sheep, horses, and cattle, poured a dose 
 of urine and molasses down the patient s throat ; 
 who soon so happily recovered as to pursue his

 under seven years, or until my patients died (in

 worse. I had often heard the southern states 
 spoken of as the high road to fortune. I was 
 told that the inhabitants were immensely opulent, 
 paid high fees with profusion, and were extreme

 New England brethren. By the advice of our 
 attorney, I lodged my accompt-books in his office,

 Anecdotes of Dr. Benjamin Franklin, whom the 
 Author visits in Philadelphia. 
 
 I CARRIED a request to the late Dr. Benjamin 
 Franklin, then president of the state of Pennsylva 
 nia, for certain papers J was to deliver further 
 southward. I anticipated much pleasure from the 
 interview with this truly great man. To see one, 
 who, from small beginnings, by the sole exertion 
 of native genius and indefatigable industry, had 
 raised himself 4o the pinnacle of politics and let 
 ters ; a man who, from an humble printer s boy, 
 had elevated himself to be the desirable compan 
 ion of the great ones of the earth : who, iioin 
 trundling a wheelbarrow in bye lanes, had been 
 advanced to pass in splendour through the courts 
 of kings : and from hawking vile ballads, to the 
 contracting and signing treaties, which gave peace 
 and independence to three millions of his fellow 
 citizens, was a sight interesting in the extreme. 
 
 I found the doctor surrounded by company, 
 most of whom were young people. He received 
 me with the attention due to a young stranger. 
 He dispatched a person for the papers I wanted ; 
 asked me politely to be seated ; inquired after

 the family I sprang from ; and told me a pleasing 
 anecdote of my brave ancestor, captain Underbill. 
 I found in tbe doctor all that simplicity of lan 
 guage which is remarkable in the fragment of 
 his life, published since bis decease, and which 
 was conspicuous in my Medical Preceptor. I 
 have since been in a room a few hours with gov 
 ernor Jay, of New York ; have heard of the hte 
 governor Livingston, of New Jersey ; and am now 
 confirmee 1 in the opinion I have suggested, that 
 men of genuine merit, as they possess the essence, 
 need not the parade of great knowledge. A rich 
 man is often plain in his attire ; and the man who 
 has abundant treasures of learning, simple in his 
 manners and style. 
 
 The doctor, in early life, was economical from 
 principle ; in his latter days perhaps from habit. 
 Poor Richard held the purse-strings of the presi 
 dent of Pennsylvania. Permit me to illustrate 
 this observation by an anecdote. Soon after I was 
 introduced, an airy thoughtless relation, from a 
 New England state, entered the room. It seems 
 he was on a party of pleasure ; and had been so 
 much involved in it, for three weeks, as not to 
 have paid his respects to his venerable relative. 
 The purpose of his present visit was to solicit the 
 loan of a small sum of money, to enable him to 
 pay his bills, and transport himself home. He 
 preluded his request with a detail of embarrass- 
 .rnents which might have befallen the most circum 
 spect. He said that he had loaded a vessel for 
 B ; and, as he did not deal on credit, had pur 
 chased beyond his current cash, and could not

 readily procure a draft upon home. The doctor 
 inquiring how much he wanted, he replied, with 
 some hesitation, fifty dollars. The benevolent old 
 gentleman went to his escritoir, and counted him 
 out a hundred. He received them with many 
 promises of punctual payment and hastily took 
 up the writing implements, to draught a note of 
 hand for the cash. The doctor, who saw into the 
 nature of the borrower s embarrassments better than 
 he was aware, and was possessed with the improb 
 ability of ever recovering his cash again, stepped 
 across the room, and laying his hand gently upon 
 his cousin s arm, said, &quot; Stop, cousin, we will 
 save the paper ; a quarter of a sheet is not of 
 great value, but it is worth saving :&quot; conveying, 
 at once, a liberal gift and gentle reprimand for the 
 borrower s prevarication and extravagance. Since 
 1 am talking of Frank in, the reader may be as 
 unwilling to leave him as I was. Allow me to 
 relate another anecdote. I do not recollect how 
 the conversation was introduced, but a young per 
 son in company mentioned his surprise that the 
 possession of great riches should ever be attended 
 with such anxiety and solicitude ; and instanced 
 Mr. R M , who he said, though in possession 
 of unbounded wealth, yet was as busy and more 
 anxious than the most assiduous clerk in his count 
 ing house. The doctor took an apple from a fruit- 
 basket, and presented it to a little child, who 
 could just totter about the room. The child could 
 scarce grasp it in his hand. He then gave it an 
 other, which occupied the other hand. Then

 ty, he presented that also. The child, after many 
 ineffectual attempts to hold the three, dropped the 
 last on the carpet, and burst into tears. See there, 
 said the philosopher ; there is a little man with 
 more riches than he can enjoy.

 Jenny Driver. When we arrived at the church, 
 we found a brilliant collection of well dressed peo 
 ple, anxiously waiting the arrival of the parson 
 who, it seems, had a small branch of the river 
 
 M to pass ; and, we afterwards learned, was 
 
 detained by the absence of his negro boy, who 
 was to ferry him over. Soon after, our impa 
 tience was relieved by the arrival of the parson in 
 his canonicals-^a young man not of the most mor 
 tified countenance, who, with a switch Called a 
 supple jack in his hand, belaboured the back and 
 head of the faulty slave all the way from the water 
 to the church door, accompanying every stioke 
 with suitable language. He enteied the church, 
 and we followed. He ascended the reading-desk, 
 and, with his face glowing with the exercise of his 
 supple jack, began the service with, u I said I 
 tvill take heed unto my ways that I sin not with 
 my tongue. I will keep my tongue as it were

 an animated discourse, of eleven minutes, upon

 and read the fourth commandment in the commun 
 ion. The whole congregation prayed fervently 
 that their hearts might be inclined to keep this 
 holy law. The blessing was pronounced ; and 
 parson and people hastened to the horse race. I 
 found the parson as much respected on the turf 
 as upon the hassock. He was one of the judges 
 of the race ; descanted, in the language of the

 turf, upon the points of the two rival horses ; and 
 the sleeve of his cassock was heavily laden with 
 the principal bets. The confidence of his par 
 ishioners was not ill founded ; for they assured 
 me, upon oath and honour, that he was a gen 
 tleman of as much uprightness as his grace the 
 archbishop of Canterbury. Ay, they would sport 
 him for a sermon or a song against any parson in 
 the union. 
 
 The whole of this extraordinary scene was nov 
 el to me. A certain staple of New England which 
 I had with me, called conscience, made my situ 
 ation, in even the passive part I bore in it, so auk- 
 ward and uneasy, that 1 could not refrain from 
 observing to my friend my surprise at the parson s 
 conduct, in chastising his servant immediately be 
 fore divine service. My friend was so happily 
 influenced by the habits of these liberal enlighten 
 ed people, that he could not even comprehend 
 the tendency of my remark. He supposed it lev 
 elled at the impropriety, not of the minister, but 
 the man ; not at the act, but the severity of the 
 chastisement ; and observed, with warmth, that 
 the parson served the villain right ; and that, if 
 he had been his slave, he would have killed the 
 black rascal, if he was sure he should have to pay 
 a hundred guineas to the public treasury for him. 
 I will note here, that the reader is requested, 
 whenever he meets with quotations of speeches 
 in the above scenes, excepting those during di 
 vine service, that he will please, that is, if his 
 habits of life will permit it, to interlard those quo 
 tations with about as many oaths as they contain

 monosyllables. He may rest assured that it will 
 render the scene abundantly more natural. It is 
 true, I might have inserted them myself and sup 
 ported it by illustrations and parodies from grave 
 authors ; but I never swear profanely myself, and 
 I think it almost as bad to oblige my readers to 
 purchase the imprecations of others. I give this 
 hint of the introduction of oaths, for the benefit 
 of my readers to the southward of Philadelphia ; 
 who, however they may enjoy a scene which re 
 flects such honour upon their country, when sea 
 soned with these palatable expletives, without 
 them, perhaps, would esteem it as tasteless and 
 vapid as a game of cards or billiards without bets , 
 or boiled veal or turkey without ham.

 men of established practice and eminence, fn 
 the interior country, the people could not distin 
 guish or encourage merit. The gains were small, 
 and tardily collected ; and in both wings of the 
 union, and I believe every where else, fortune and 
 fame are generally to be acquired, in the learned 
 professions, solely by a patient undeviating ap^ 
 plication to local business. 
 
 If dissipation could have afforded pleasure to a 
 mind yearning after professional fame and inde 
 pendence, I might, so long as my money lasted, 
 have been happy at the southward. I was often 
 invited to the turf; and might have had the hon 
 our of being intoxicated frequently with the most 
 respectable characters. An association with the 
 well educated of the other sex was not so readily 
 attained. There was a haughty reserve in the 
 manners of the young ladies. Every attempt at 
 familiarity in a young stranger, habituated to the 
 social but respectable intercourse customary in the 
 northern states, excited alarm. With my New 
 England ideas, I could not help viewing, in the 
 anxious efforts of their parents and relatives to 
 repel every approach to innocent and even chas 
 tened intercourse, a strong suspicion of that virtue 
 they were so solicitous to protect. 
 
 Depressed by the gloomy view of my prospects, 
 and determined never to face iny parents again 
 under circumstances which would be burthensome to 
 them, I attempted to obtain practice in the town 
 
 of F , in Virginia ; but in vain. The very 
 
 decorum, prudence, and economy, which would 
 have enhanced my character at home, were here

 construed into poverty of spirit. To obtain med 
 ical practice, it was expedient to sport, bet, drink? / 
 swear, &c. with my patients. My purse forbad 
 the former ; my habits of life the latter. My 
 cash wasted, and I was near suffering. I was ob 
 liged to dispose of my books for present subsist 
 ence ; and, in that country, books were not the 
 prime articles of commerce. To avoid starving, 
 I again contemplated keeping a school. In that 
 country, knowledge was viewed as a handicraft 
 trade. The school-masters, before the war, had 
 been usually collected from unfortunate European 
 youth, of some school learning, sold for their pas 
 sage into America : so that to purchase a school 
 master and a negro was almost synonymous. Mr. 
 
 j _ n? and some other citizens of the world who 
 
 had been cast among them, had, by their writings, 
 influence and example, brought the knowledge of 
 letters into some^repute since the revolution ; but 
 I believe those excellent men have yet to lament 
 the general inefficacy of their liberal efforts. This 
 statement, and my own prior experience in school- 
 keeping, would have determined me rather to 
 have preferred labouring with the slaves on their 
 plantations than sustaining the slavery and con 
 tempt of a school. 
 
 When reduced to my last dollar, and beginning 
 to suffer from the embarrassments of debt, I was 
 invited by a sea captain, who knew my friends, 
 to accept the birth of surgeon in his ship. Every 
 new pursuit has its flattering prospects. I was 
 encouraged by handsome wages, and a privilege 
 in the ship to carry an adventure, for the purchase

 of which the owners were to advance me on ac 
 count of my pay. I was to be companion to the 
 captain, and have a fine chance of seeing the 
 world. To quit my home for all parts of the 
 union I considered as home to tempt the peril 
 ous ocean, and encounter the severities of a sea 
 faring life, the diseases of torrid climes, and per 
 haps a total separation from my friends and pa 
 rents, was melancholy ; but the desire to see the 
 world, to acquire practical knowledge in my pro 
 fession, to obtain property, added to the necessity 
 of immediate subsistence, and the horrors of a 
 jail, determined me to accept his offer. I accor 
 dingly entered surgeon on board the ship Freedom, 
 captain Sidney Russell commander, freighted with 
 tobacco bound to London, and thence to the coast 
 of Africa. 1 had little to do in my passage to 
 London, my destination as a surgeon being prin 
 cipally in the voyage from that city to the African 
 coast, and thence to the West Indies ; and, if I 
 had not suffered from a previous nausea or sea 
 sickness, the novelty of the scene would have ren 
 dered me tolerably happy. In the perturbation 
 of my thoughts, I had omitted writing to my pa 
 rents of the places of my destination. This care

 weight in the future treaty between them and the 
 French nation?&quot; Peter, who had listened with 
 great seeming attention, now mildly replied. &quot; I 
 will not say but that your arguments are cogent, 
 though not entirely convincing. As it is a subject 
 rather out of my line, 1 will, for form sake, hold 
 the negative of your proposition, and leave it to 
 the good company which is right.&quot; &quot; Agreed ;&quot; 
 said Paine, who saw himself surrounded by his ad 
 mirers. &quot;Well, gentlemen,&quot; said Peter, with 
 all the gravity of a speaker of the house of com 
 mons, &quot; you that are of the opinion that the mi 
 nority, in all deliberative bodies, ought in all ca 
 ses to govern the majority, please to rise in the 
 affirmative.&quot; Paine immediately stood up him 
 self, and, as he had foreseen, we all rose in his 
 favour. &quot; Theni rise in the negative,&quot; cried Pe 
 ter. &quot; I am the wise minority, who ought in all 
 cases to govern your ignorant majority ; and, con 
 sequently, upon your own principles I carry the 
 vote. Let it be recorded.&quot; 
 
 This unexpected manoeuvre raised a hearty 
 laugh. Paine retired from the presence of tri- 
 amphant wit, mortified with being foiled at h& 
 own weapon^.

 Reasonable Conjectures upon the Motives which in 
 duced Thomas Paine to write that little Book 
 called the &quot; Jlge of Reason.&quot; 
 
 IN the frequent interviews 1 had with this celebra 
 ted republican apostle, I never heard him express 
 the least doubt of, or cast the smallest reflection 
 upon, revealed religion. He spake of the glow ing 
 expressions of the Jewish prophets with fervour ; 
 and had quoted liberally from the Scriptures in 
 his &quot; Common Sense. &quot; How he came to write 
 that unreasonable little pamphlet called The Jlge 
 of Reason, 1 am at a loss to conjecture. &amp;lt;The pro 
 bable opinion attributes it to his passion for para 
 dox ; or that this small morsel of infidelity was 
 offered as a sacrifice to save his life from the de 
 vouring cruelty of Robespierre, that Moloch of the 
 French nation. It probably had its desired effect ; 
 for annihilating revealed religion could not but af 
 ford a diabolical pleasure to that ferocious wretch

 a sanction for their cruelties while the least vestige 
 of any thing sacred remained among men. 
 
 When the reign of the terrorists ceased, an 
 apology was expected, and, even by the pious yet 
 catholic American, would have been received. To 
 the offended religion of his country no propitiatory 
 sacrifice was made. This missionary of vice pro 
 ceeded proselyting. He has added second parts, 
 and made other and audacious adjuncts to deism. 
 No might nor greatness escapes him. He has 
 vilified a great prophet, the saviour of the Gentiles; 
 he has railed at Washington, a saviour of his coun 
 try. A tasteful though irreligious scholar might 
 tolerate a chastised scepticism, if exhibited by 
 an acute Hume, or an eloquent Bolingbroke. But 
 one cannot repress the irritability of the fiery 
 Hotspur, when one beholds the pillars of morality 
 shaken by the rude shock of this modern Vandal. 
 The reader shouM learn that his paltry system is 
 only an outrage of wine ;* and that it is in the 
 ale-house he most vigorously assults the authority 
 of the prophets, and laughs most loudly at the 
 Gospel when in his cups.

 coat of Africa, thence to Barbadoes and to South- 
 Carolina with a cargo of slaves. 
 
 We were favoured with a clear sky and pleasant 
 gales ; after a short and agreeable voyage we touch 
 ed at Porto Santo, one of the Madeira Isles, where 
 we watered and supplied ourselves with fresh 
 provisions in abundance, to which the captain 
 added, at my request, a quantity of Madeira, 
 malmsey and tent wines, for the sick. We had a 
 fine run from the Madeiras to the Canary Isles. 
 The morning after we sailed I was highly gratified 
 with a full view of the island and peak of Ten- 
 eriffe ; which made its appearance the day before, 
 rising above the ocean, at one hundred miles dis- , 
 tance. We anchored off Fuertaventura, one of 
 the Canaries, in a good bottom. I went on shore 
 with the mate to procure green vegetables ; as 
 I ever esteemed them the best specific for that 
 dreadful sea disorder, the scurvy. Before we had 
 reached the Madeiras, though I had stored our 
 medicine chest with the best antiscorbutics, and 
 we had a plenty of dried vegetables on board, 
 yet the scurvy had begun to infect us. A plenti 
 ful distribution of green vegetables, after our arri 
 val at Porto Santo, soon expelled it from the crew. 
 At Fuertaventura I was delighted with the wild 
 notes of the Canary-bird, far surpassing the most 
 excellent of those I had seen in cages in the Uni 
 ted States. 
 
 I was anxious to visit the Cape de Verd Islands , 
 but, our course being too far east, we ran dowc

 tions of the English and French jcrowns have an* 
 nexed its only importance. The French officers 
 received us with politeness, arid were extremely 
 anxious for news from their pasent country. Soon 
 after we dropped anchor off Loango city, upon 
 a small well-peopled island near the coast of 
 Congo or Lower Guinea, in possession of the 
 Portuguese. Our captain carried his papers on 
 shore, and the next day weighed anchor and stood 
 in for the continent All hands were employed 
 to unlade the ship, aud the cargo was deposited 
 in a Portuguese factory,, at a place called Cacon- 
 go, near the mouth! ot the river Zaire. The day 
 after our arrival at Cacongo, several Portuguese 
 and negro merchants, hardly distinguishable how 
 ever by their manners, employments, or complex 
 ions, came to confer with the captain about the 
 purchase of our cargo of slaves. They contracted 
 deliver him two hundred and fifty head of slaves 
 eiert days time. To hear these men converse 
 upon the purchase of feuia.p beings, with the same 
 indifference,, and nearly in the- same language, as 
 if they were contracting for so many head of cattle 
 or swine, shocked, me exceedingly, But when 
 I suffered my imagination to rove to the habitation 
 of these victims to this infamous cruel commerce, 
 and fancied that I saw the peaceful husbandman 
 dragged from his native farm, the fond husband 
 torn from .the embraces of his beloved wife, the 
 jftotper frotn her babes, thejdnder child from the 
 auras of its parent, and all the tender endearing ties

 I execrated myself for even the involuntary part 
 1 bore in this execrable traffic : I thought of my 
 native land, and blushed. When the captain kind 
 ly inquired of me how many slaves i thought 
 my privilege in the ship entitled me to transport for 
 my adventure, I rejected my privilege with horror, 
 and declared I would sooner suffer servitude than 
 purchase a slave. This observation was received 
 in the great cabin with repeated bursts of laughter, 
 and excited many a stroke of coarse ridicule. 
 Captain Russell observed, that he would not insist 
 upon my using my privilege if I had so much of 
 the yankee about me. Here is my clerk, Ned 
 Randolph, will jump at the chance, though the 
 rogue has been rather unlucky in the trade. Out 
 of five-and-twenty negroes he purchased, he nev 
 er carried but one alive to port, and that poor devil 
 was broken winded ; and he was obliged to sell 
 him for half price in Antigua. 
 
 Punctual to the day of the delivery, the con 
 tractors appeared, and brought with them about 
 one hundred and fifty negroes men, women, and 
 children. The men were fastened together in 
 pairs by a bar of iron, with a collar to receive 
 the neck at each extremity ; a long pole was pas 
 sed over their shoulder, and between each two was 
 bound by a staple and ring, through which the pole 
 was thrust, and thus twenty, and sometimes, thir 
 ty were connected together ; while their conductors 
 incessantly applied the scourge to those who loiter 
 ed, or sought to strangle themselves by lifting their 
 feet from the ground in despair ; which sometimes 
 had been successfully attempted. The women

 and children were bound with cords, and driven 
 forward by the whip. When they arrived at the 
 factory the men were unlosed from the poles, but 
 still chained in pairs, and turned into strong cells 
 built for the purpose. The dumb sorrow of some, 
 the phrensy of others, the sobbings and tears of 
 the children, and shrieks of the women, when they 
 were presented to our captain, so affected me, that 
 I was hastening from this scene of barbarity on 
 board the ship, when 1 was called by the mate, 
 and discovered, to my surprise and horror, 
 that, by my station in the ship, I had a principal 
 and active part of this inhuman transaction impos 
 ed upon me. As surgeon, it was my duty to in 
 spect the bodies of the slaves, to see, as the cap 
 tain expressed himself, that our owners were not 
 shammed off with unsound flesh. In this inspec 
 tion 1 was assisted by Randolph the olerk, ana two 
 stout sailors. It was transacted with all that un 
 feeling insolence which wanton barbarity can in 
 flict upon defenceless wretchedness. The man, 
 the affrighted child, the modest matron, and the 
 timid virgin, were alike exposed to this severe 
 scrutiny, equally insulting to humanity and com 
 mon decency. 
 
 I cannot even now reflect on this transaction 
 without shuddering. I have deplored my conduct 
 with tears of anguish ; and I pray a merciful God, 
 the common parent of the great family of the 
 universe, who hath made of one flesh and one 
 blood all nations of the earth, that the miseries, 
 the insults, and cruel woundings, I afterwards re-

 Treatment of the Slaves on board the Ship, 
 
 OF one hundred &amp;gt;and fifty Africans, we rejected 
 seventeen as not merchantable. While I was 
 doubting which to lament most those who were 
 about being precipated into all the miseries of an 
 American slavery, or those whom we had rejected 
 as too wretched for slaves captain Russell was 
 congratulating the slave-contractors upon the im 
 mense good luck they had in not suffering more 
 by this lot of human creatures. I understood that, 
 what from wounds received by some of these mis 
 erable creatures at their capture, or in their vio 
 lent struggles for liberty, or attempts at suicide, 
 and what with the fatigue of a long journey, partly 
 over the burning sands of a sultry climate, it was 
 usual to estimate the loss in the passage to the 
 sea-shore at twenty -five in a hundred.

 No sooner was the purchase completed, than 
 these wretched Africans were transported in herds 
 aboard the ship, and immediately precipitated 
 between decks, where a strong chain, attached to 
 a staple in the lower deck, was ri vetted to the 
 bar before described ; and then the men were 
 chained in pairs and hand-cuffed, and two sailors 
 wiiiitcuHasses guarded: eveky twenty ; while the 
 women 1 arid children were tied f together in pairs 
 wilb rope?;; a*)d 6T&amp;gt;l3geii to supply the men with 
 provisions and -the siifsli-bucket ; or, if the young 
 women were released, it was only to gratify the 
 brutal lust of the sailors : for though 1 cannot say 
 1 ever was witness to an actual rape, yet the fre 
 quent shrieks of these forlorn females in the births 
 of the seamen left me little charity to doubt of 
 the repeated commission of that degrading crime. 
 The eve after we had received the slaves on board, 
 all hands were piped on deck, and ordered to as 
 sist in manufacturing and knotting cat-o nine-tails, 
 the application of which, 1 was informed, was al 
 ways necessary to bring the slaves to their appe 
 tite. The night after they came on board was 
 spent by these wretched people in sobbings, groans, 
 tears, and the most heart-rending bursts of sorrow 
 and despair. The next morning all was still. Sur 
 prised by this unexpected silence, I almost ho 
 ped that providence, in pity to these her misera 
 ble children, had permitted some kindly suffoca 
 tion to put a period to their anguish. It was nei 
 ther novel nor unexpected to the ship s crew. It is 
 only the dumb fit come on, cried every one : we 
 will cure them. After breakfast, the whole ship s

 crew went between decks, and carried with them 
 the provisions for the slaves, which they one and 
 all refused to eat. A more affecting group of mis 
 ery was never seen. These injured Africans, pre 
 ferring death to slavery, or perhaps buoyed above 
 the fear of dissolution by their religion, which 
 taught them to look with an eye of faith to a coun 
 try beyond the grave, where they should again 
 meet those friends and relatives from whose en 
 dearments they had been torn, and where no fiend 
 should torment or Christian thirst for gold, had 
 resolved to starve themselves, and every eye 
 lowered the fixed resolve of this deadly intent. 
 In vain were the men beaten. They refused to 
 taste one mouthful ; and I believe, would have 
 died under the operation, if the ingenious cruel 
 ty of the clerk, Randolph had not suggested the 
 plan of whipping the women and children in sight 
 of the men ; assuring the men they should be tor 
 mented until all had eaten. What the torments 
 exercised on the bodies of these brave Airicans 
 failed to produce, the feelings of nature effected. 
 The negro, who could undauntedly expire under 
 the anguish of the lash, could not view the ago 
 nies of his wife, child, or mother , and though re 
 peatedly encouraged by these female sufferers to 
 persevere unto death, unmoved by their torments, 
 yet, though the man dared to die, the father re- 
 iented, and in a few hours they had all eaten their 
 provisions, mingled with their tears. 
 
 Our slave-dealers being unable to fulfil their 
 contract, unless we tarried three weeks longer, our 
 captain concluded to remove to some other market.

 We accordingly weighed anchor, steered for Benin, 
 and anchored in the river Formosa, where we 
 took in one hundred and fifteen more slaves. The 
 same process in the purchase was pursued here ; 
 and though I frequently assured the captain, as a 
 * physician, that it was impracticable to stow fifty 
 more persons between decks without endangering 
 health and life, yet the whole hundred and fifteen 
 were thrust, with the rest, between decks. The 
 stagnant confined air of this infernal hole, rendered 
 more deleterious by the stench of the faeces and 
 violent perspiration of such a crowd, occasioned 
 putrid diseases ; and, even while in the mouth ot 
 the Formosa, it was usual to throw one or two ne 
 gro corpses over every day. It was in vain that I 
 remonstrated to the captain. In vain I enforced the 
 necessity of more commodious births, and a more 
 free influx of air for the slaves. In vain I repre 
 sented that these miserable people had been used 
 to the vegetable diet and pure air of a country 
 life ; that at home they were remarkable for clean 
 liness of person, the very rites of their religion 
 consisting, almost entirely, in frequent ablutions. 
 The captain was by this time prejudiced against 
 me. He observed that he did not doubt my skill, 
 and would be bound by my advice, as to the health 
 of those on board his ship, when he found I was 
 actuated by the interest of the owners ; but he 
 feared that 1 was now moved by some yankee non 
 sense about humanity. 
 
 Randolph the clerk blamed me in plain terms. 
 He said he had made seven African voyages with 
 as good surgeons as I was ; and that it was their

 common practice, when an infectious disorder 
 prevailed, among the slaves, to make critical search 
 for all those who had the slightest symptoms of it, 
 or whose habits of body inclined them to it ; to 
 tie them up and cast them over the ship s side to 
 gether, and thus at one dash to purify the ship. 
 What signifies, added he, the lives of the black 
 devils ? They love to die. You cannot please them 
 better than by chucking them into the water. 
 
 When we stood out to sea, the rolling of the 
 vessel brought on the sea sickness, which encrea- 
 sed the filth : the weather being rough, we were 
 obliged to close some of the ports which ventila 
 ted the space between decks, and death raged 
 dreadfully among the slaves. Above two thirds 
 were diseased. It was affecting to observe the 
 ghastly smile on x the countenance of the dying Af 
 rican, as if rejoicing to escape the cruelty of his 
 oppressors. I noticed one man, who gathered all 
 his strength, and in one last effort spoke with 
 great emphasis, and expired. I understood by 
 the linguist, that with his dying breath he in 
 vited his wife and a boy and girl to follow 
 him quickly, and slake their thirst with him at 
 the cool streams of the fountain of their Great 
 Father, beyond the reach of the wild white beasts. 
 The captain was now alarmed for the success ot 
 his voyage ; and, upon my urging the necessity 
 of landing the slaves, he ordered the ship about, 
 and we anchored near an uninhabited part of the 
 Gold Coast I conjecture, not far from Cape St- 
 Paul.

 Tents were erected on the shore, and the 
 sick landed. Under my direction they recovered 
 surprisingly. It was affecting to see the effect 
 gentle usage had upon these hitherto sullen obsti 
 nate people. As I had the sole direction of the 
 hospital, they looked on me as the source of this 
 sudden transition from the filth and rigour of the 
 ship to the cleanliness and kindness of the shore. 
 Their gratitude was excessive. When they re 
 covered so far as to walk out, happy was he who 
 could, by picking a few berries, gathering the 
 wild fruits of the country, or doing any menial 
 services, manifest his affection for me. Our lin 
 guist has told me, he has olten heard them behind 
 the bushes praying to their God for my prosperity, 
 and asking him with earnestness, why he put my 
 good black soul into a white body. In twelve 
 days all the convalescents were returned to the 
 ship, qxcept live, who staid with me on shore^ 
 and were to b^ taken on board the next day.

 Fundia, I sat at the door of my tent, and per 
 ceived our ship, which lay at one mile s distance, 
 getting under way, apparently in great haste. 
 The jolly boat, about ten minutes before, had 
 made towards the shore ; but was recalled by a 
 musket-shot from the ship. Alarmed by this 
 unexpected manoeuvre, I ran to the top of a small 
 hill, at the back of the hospital, and plainly dis 
 covered a square-rigged vessel in the offing en 
 deavouring to lock our ship within the land ; but 
 a land breeze springing up from the north-cast, 
 which did not extend to the strange vessel, and 
 our ship putting out all her light sails, being well 
 provided with ring sail, scudding sails, water sails, 
 and driver, I could perceive she outsailed her. It 
 was soon so dark that I lost sight of both, and I 
 passed a night of extreme anxiety, which was in 
 creased by what I conjectured to be flashes of guns 
 in the south-west ; though at too great distance for 
 me to hear the report?. 
 
 The next morning no vessels were to be seen 
 on the coast, and the ensuing day was spent in 
 a state of dreadful suspense. Although I had 
 provisions enough with me for some weeks, and 
 was sheltered by our tents, yet to be separated 
 from my friends and country, perhaps for ever, and 
 to fall into the hands of the barbarous people which 
 infested this coast, was truly alarming. The five 
 Africans who were with me could not conceal their 
 joy at the departure of the ship. By signs they 
 manifested their affection towards me ; and when f 
 signified to them that the vessel was gone not to re,- 
 furn, they clapped their hands, and pointing inland.

 signified a desire to convey me to their native 
 country, where they were sure I should be happy. 
 By their consultation, I could see that they were 
 totally ignorant of the w#y. On the third day, 
 towards evening, to my great joy, I saw a sail 
 approaching the shore, at the prospect of which 
 rny African associates manifested every sign of 
 horror. I immediately concluded that no great 
 blame would arise from my not detaining five men 
 in the absence of the ship ; and I intimated to 
 them that they might conceal themselves in the 
 brush, and escape. Four quitted me ; but one, 
 who made me comprehend that he had a beloved 
 son among the slaves, refused to go, preferring 
 the company of his child, in slavery itself, to free 
 dom and the land of his nativity. I retired to 
 rest, pleased with the imagination of soon rejoin- 
 ing my friends, and proceeding to my native coun 
 try. On the morning of the fourth day, as I was 
 sleeping in my tent with the affectionate negro at 
 my feet, I was suddenly awakened by the blow 
 ing of conch-shells, and the sound of uncouth 
 voices. I arose to dress myself, when the tent was 
 overset, and I received a blow from the back of 
 a sabre, which levelled me to the earth. I was 
 immediately seized and bound by severel men of 
 sallow and fierce demeanour, in strange habits, 
 who spake a language I could not comprehend. 
 With the negro, tents, baggage, and provisions, 
 I was carred to the boat, which being loaded was 
 immediately pushed off from the shore, and rowed 
 towards a vessel, which 1 now for the first time

 which was in pursuit of the Sympathy. She was 
 rigged differently from any I had ever seen, hav 
 ing two masts, a large square main-sail, another of 
 equal size, seized by the middle of a main yard 
 to her fore-mast, and what the sailors call a shoul 
 der of mutton sail abaft ; which with top-sails and 
 two banks of oars, impelled her through the water 
 with amazing velocity : although, for the clumsi 
 ness of her rigging, an American seaman would 
 never have pronounced her a good sea-boat. At 
 her ma in- mast head was a broad black pennant, 
 with a crescent and a drawn sabre in white and 
 red emblazoned in the middle. The sides of the 
 vessel were manned as we approached ; and a 
 tackle being let down, the hook was attached to 
 the cord which bound me, and I was hoisted oa 
 board in the twinkling of an eye. Then, being 
 unbound, I was tarried upon the quarter-deck, 
 where a man, who appeared to be the captain, 
 glittering in silks, pearl, and gold, sat cross-legged 
 upon a velvet cushion to receive me. He was 
 nearly encircled by a band of men, with mon 
 strous tufts of hair on their upper lips, dressed in 
 habits of the same mode with their leader s, but 
 of coarser contexture, with drawn scimetars in 
 their hands ; and by his side a man of lighter 
 complexion, who, by the captain s command in 
 quired of me in good English if I was an English 
 man. I replied I was an American, a citizen of the

 the captain, than, at a disdainful nod of his head, 
 I was again seized, hand-cuffed, and thrust into

 four hours, without straw to sleep on, or any thing 
 to eat or drink. The treatment we gave the un 
 happy Africans on board the Sympathy now came 
 full into my mind ; and, what was more mortify 
 ing, I discovered that the negro who was captured 
 with me was at liberty, and fared as well as the 
 sailors on board the vessel. I had not however 
 been confined more than one half-hour, when the 
 interpreter came to examine me privately respect 
 ing the destination of the ship, to which he sus 
 pected I belonged ; was anxious to know if she 
 had her full cargo of slaves ; what was her force ; 
 whether she had English papers on board ; and if 
 she did not intend to stop at some other African 
 port. From him I learned that I was captured 
 by an Algerine rover, Hamed Hali Saad captain ; 
 and should be carried into slavery at Algiers. 
 After I had lain twenty-four hours in this loath 
 some place, covered with vermin, parched with 
 thirst, and fainting with hunger, 1 was startled at a 
 light through the hatchway, which opening softly, 
 a hand presented me a cloth, dripping with cold 
 water, in which a small quantity of boiled rice 
 was wrapped. The door closed again softly, and 
 I was left to enjoy my good fortune in the dark. 
 If Abraham had indeed sent Lazarus to the rich 
 man in torment, it appears to me he could not 
 have received a greater pleasure from the cool 
 water on his tongue than I experienced in suck 
 ing the moisture from this cloth. The next day, 
 the same kindly hand appeared again with the 
 same refreshment. I begged to see ray benefac- 
 for. The door opened further, and I saw a coun-

 I will fly to our fellow citizens in the southern

 the pleadings of nature,, I will conjure them for

 their orators, representatives, senators, and even 
 their constitutions of government, have declared

 sable friend had no occasion to visit me a third 
 time ; for I was taken from my confinement, and, 
 after being stripped of the few clothes and the

 this people as the most blasphemous infidels. In 
 ten days after 1 was captured, the rover passed up

 ed to a heavy strong tower of the castle. The 
 Portuguese prisoners, to which nation the Alger- 
 ines have the most violent antipathy, were imn.e- 
 diately, with every mark of contempt, spurned 
 into a dark dungeon beneath the foundations of 
 the tower, though there were several merchants 
 of eminence and one young nobleman in the num 
 ber. The Spaniards, whom the Dey s subjects 
 detest as much and fear more, were confined with 
 me in a grated room on the second slory. We re 
 ceived the same evening rations similar to what 
 we understood w r ere issued to the garrison. The 
 next day we were all led to a cleansing house, 
 where we were cleared from vermin, our hair cut 
 short, and our beards close shaved ; thence taken 
 to a bath, and, after being well bathed, we were 
 clothed in coarse^ linen drawers, a straight waist 
 coat of the same without sleeves, and a kind of 
 tunic or loose coat over the whole, which with a 
 pair of leather slippers, and a blue cotton cop, 
 equipped us, as \ve were informed, to appear m . 
 the presence of the Dey, who was to select the 
 tenth prisoner from us in person. The next morn 
 ing the dragomen or interpreters were- very busy 
 in impressing upon us the most profound respect 
 for the Dey s person and power, and teaching us 
 the obeisance necessary to be made in our ap 
 proaches to this august potentate. Soon after we 
 were paraded, and captain Hamed presented each 
 of us with a paper, written in a base kind of Ara 
 bic, describing, as 1 was informed, our persons, 
 names, country, and conditions in life, so far as 
 our captors could collect from our several examin-

 ations. Upon the back of each paper was a mark 
 or number. The same mark was painted upon a 
 flat oval piece of wood, somewhat like a painter s 
 pallette, and suspended by a small brass chain, to 
 our necks, hanging upon our breasts. The guards 
 then formed a hollow square. We were blind 
 folded until we passed the fortifications, and then 
 suffered to view the city and the immense rabble 
 which surrounded us, until we came to the palace 
 of the Dey. Here, after much military parade, 
 the gates were thrown open, and we entered a 
 spacious court-yard, at the upper end pf which 
 the Dey was seated upon an eminence, covered 
 with the richest carpeting fringed with gold. A 
 circular canopy of Persian silk was raised over his 
 head, from which were suspended curtains of the 
 richest embroidery, drawn into festoons by silk 
 cords and tassels, enriched with pearls. Over the 
 eminence upon the right and left were canopies, 
 which almost vied in riches with the former, under 
 which stood the mufti, his numerous hadgis, and 
 his principal officers civil and military ; and on 
 each side about seven hundred foot-guards were 
 drawn up in the form of a half moon. 
 
 The present Dey, Vizier Hassen Bashaw, is 
 about forty years of age, five feet ten inches in 
 height, inclining to corpulency, with a counte 
 nance rather comely than commanding ; an eye 
 which betrays sagacity rather than inspires awe 
 the latter is sufficiently inspired by the fierce 
 appearance of his guards, the splendour of his at 
 tendants, the grandeur of his court, and the mag 
 nificence of his attire. He was arrayed in a

 sumptuous Turkish habit. His feet were shod 
 with buskins, bound upon his legs with diamond 
 buttons in loops of pearl ; round his waist was a 
 broad sash glittering with jewels, to which was 
 suspended a broad scymetar, the hilt of which 
 dazzled the eye with brilliants of the first water, 
 and the sheath of which was of the finest velvet, 
 studded with gems and the purest gold. In his 
 scarf were stuck a poignard and pair of pistols 
 of exquisite *workmanship. These pistols and 
 poignard were said to have been a present from 
 the late unfortunate Lewis the Sixteenth. The 
 former was of pure gold, and the value of the 
 work was said to exceed that of the precious metal 
 Jtwo hundred times. Upon the Dey s head was 
 a turban with the point erect, which is peculiar to 
 the royal family.N A large diamond crescent shone 
 conspicuously in the front, on the back of which 
 a socket received the quills of two large ostrich 
 feathers, which waved in graceful majesty over 
 his head. The prisoners were directed by turns 
 to approach the foot of the eminence. When 
 within thirty paces, we were made to throw our 
 selves upon the earth and creep towards the Dey, 
 licking the dust as a token of reverence and sub 
 mission. As each captive approached, he was 
 commanded to rise, pull off his slippers, and stand 
 with his face bowed to the ground, and his arms 
 crossed over his breast. The chieux or secretary 
 then took the paper he carried, and read the same. 
 To some the Dey put questions by his dragoman ; 
 others were dismissed by a slight nod of his head. 
 After some consultation among the chief men, an

 officer came to where the prisoners were paraded, 
 and called for three by the number which was 
 marked on their breasts. The Dey s prerogative 
 gives him the right to select the tenth of all pris 
 oners ; and, as the service or ransom of them con 
 stitutes one part of his revenue, his policy is to 
 choose those whose friends or wealth would be 
 most likely to enrich his coffers. At this time he 
 selected two wealthy Portuguese merchants, and 
 a young nobleman of the same nation, called Don 
 Juan Combri. Immediately after this selection, 
 we were carried to a strong house or rather prison 
 in the city, and there guarded by an officer and 
 goiue of the crew of the Rover that had taken us. 
 The remainder of us being considered as private 
 property, another selection was made by the cap 
 tain and owners of the , Rover ; and all such as 
 could probably pay their ransom in a short time 
 were removed into a ^place of safety, and suffered 
 only a close confinement. The remnant of my 
 companions, being only eleven, consisted of the 
 negro slave, five Portuguese, two Spanish sailors, 
 an Italian fiddler, a Dutchman from the Cape of 
 Good Hope, and his Hottentot servant. As we 
 could proffer no probability of ransom, we were 
 reserved for another fate.

 The Slave Market. 
 
 ON the next market day we were stripped of the 
 dress in which we appeared at court. A napkin 
 was wrapped round our loins, and a coarse cloak 
 thrown over our shoulders. We were then ex 
 posed for sale in the market-place, which was a 
 spacious square, N inclosed by ranges of low shops, 
 in different sections of which were exposed the 
 various articles intended for sale. One section 
 was gay with flowers ; another exposed all the 
 fruits of the season grapes, dates, pomegranates, 
 and oranges, lay in tempting baskets ; a third was 
 devoted to sallads and pot herb? ; a fourth to milk 
 and cream. Between every section was a small 
 room, where those who come to market might oc 
 casionally refresh themselves with a pipe of tobac 
 co, a cud of opium, a glass of sherbet, or other 
 cooling liquors. Sherbet is composed of lemons, 
 oranges, sugar, and water it is what we in New 
 England call beverage. In the centre of the mar 
 ket an oblong square was railed in, where the deal 
 ers in beasts and slaves exposed their commodities

 for sale : here were camels, mules, asses, goats, 
 hares, dromedaries, women and men, and all other 
 creatures whether for appetite or use ; and I ob 
 served that the purchasers turned from one arti 
 cle to the other with equal indifference. The wo 
 men slaves were concealed in a latticed shop, but 
 the men were exposed in open view in a stall sit 
 uated between those appropriated to the asses and 
 to the kumrah, a wretched looking though service 
 able animal in that country, propagated by a jack 
 upon a cow. I now discovered the reason of the 
 alteration in our dress ; for, as the people here no 
 more than in New England love to buy a pig in 
 the poke, our loose coats were easily thrown open, 
 and the purchaser had an opportunity of exam 
 ining into the state of our bodies. It was aston 
 ishing to observe how critically they examined 
 my muscles, to see if 1 was naturally strong j 
 moved my lirnbs in various directions, to detect 
 any latent lameness or injury in the parts ; and 
 struck suddenly before my eyes, to judge by my 
 winking if I was clear sighted. Though I could 
 not understand their language, I doubt not they 
 spoke of my activity, strength, age, &c, in the 
 same manner as we at home talk in the swop of 
 a horse. One old man was very critical in his 
 examination of me. He made me walk, run, lie 
 down, and lift a weight of about sixty pounds. 
 He went out and soon returned with another man. 
 They conferred together, and the second was more 
 critical in his examination than the first. He ob 
 liged me to run a few rods, and then laid his 
 band suddenly to my heart, to see, as I conjecture.

 if my wind was good. By the old man I was 
 purchased. What the price given for me was I 
 cannot tell. An officer of the market attested the 
 contract, and I was obliged by the master of the 
 shop, who sold me upon commission for the benefit 
 of the persons concerned in the Rover, to lie down 
 in the street, take the foot of my new master, and 
 place it upon my neck making to him what the 
 lawyers call attornment. 1 was then seized by 
 two slaves, and led to the house of my new mas 
 ter, 
 
 Perhaps the free citizen of the United States 
 may, in the warmth of his patriotism, accuse me 
 of a tameness of spirit in submitting to such gross 
 disgrace. I will not justify myself. Perhaps I 
 ought to have asserted the dignity of our nation, 
 in despite of bastinadoes, chains, or even death 
 itself. Charles the Twelfth of Sweden has how 
 ever been stigmatised by the historian as a mad 
 man, for opposing the insulting Turk, when a pris 
 oner, though assisted by nearly two hundred brave 
 men. If any of my dear countrymen censure 
 my want of due spirit, 1 have only to wish hir 
 in my situation at Algiers, that he may avail him 
 self of a noble opportunity of suffering gloriously 
 lor his country.

 THE higher his rank in society, the further is man

 round the great, and often excludes from them the 
 finer feelings of the heart : the wretched are all 
 of one family, and ever regard each other as 
 brethren. Among the slaves of my new master 
 I was received with pity, and treated with ten 
 derness, bordering upon fraternal affection. They 
 could not indeed speak my language, and I was 
 ignorant of theirs ; but by dividing the scanty 
 meal, composing my couch of straw, and allevia

 weakness, I will confess that some time after I 
 was captured I often suffered fancy to cheat me 
 of my &quot; weary moments,&quot; by pourtraying those 
 scenes which had often amused me in my closet, 
 and delighted me on the stage. Sometimes I even 
 contemplated with pleasure the company and con 
 verse of my fellow slaves. I expected to find 
 them men of rank at least, if not of learning. I 
 fancied my master s cook an English lord ; his 
 valet an Italian duke ; his groom a knight of Mal 
 ta ; and even his foot- boy some little lively 
 French marquis. I fancied my future master s 
 head gardener taking me one side, professing 
 the warmest friendship, and telling me in confi 
 dence that he was a Spanish Don with forty noble 
 names ; that he had fallen in love with my mas 
 ter s fair daughter, whose mother was a Christian 
 slave : that the young lady was equally charmed 
 &amp;gt;vith him ; that she was to rob her father of a 
 rich casket of jewels, there being no dishonour in 
 stealing from an infidel ; jump into his arms in 
 boy s clothes that very night, and escape by a ves 
 sel already provided to his native country. I saw 
 in imagination all this accomplished. I saw the 
 lady descend the rope-ladder ; heard the old man 
 nnd his servants pursue ; saw the lady carried off 
 breathless in the arms of her knight ; arrive safe 
 in Spain ; was present at the lady s baptism into 
 the catholic church, and at her marriage with her 
 noble deliverer. I was myself almost stifled with 
 the caresses of the noble family, for the part I 
 had borne in this perilous adventure ; and in fine 
 married to Donna somebody, the Don s beautiful

 my reverie by a poor fellow slave, whose extreme 
 ignorance had almost blunted the sensibility of 
 bis own wretchedness. 
 
 Indeed, so sweet were the delusions of my own 
 fancy, I am loth to destroy the innocent gratifica 
 tion which the readers of novels and plays enjoy 
 from the works of a Behn and a Colman ; but the 
 sober character of a historian compels me to assure 
 my readers, that, whatever may have happened 
 in the sixteenth century, I never saw during my 
 captivity a man of any rank, family, or fortune, 
 among the. menial slaves, the Dey, as I have al 
 ready observed, selecting his tenth prisoner from 
 those who would most probably afford the richest 
 ransom : those concerned in the captures are in 
 fluenced by the same motive. All who may be 
 expected to be ransomed are deprived of their lib 
 erty it is true ; but fed, clothed, and never put to 
 manual labour, except as a punishment for some 
 actual crime, or attempting to recover their lib- 
 erty. The menial slaves are generally composed 
 of the dregs of those nations with whom they are 
 at war ; but, though my fellow slaves were gross 
 ly illiterate, I must do them the justice to say they 
 had learned well the kinder virtues : those virtues 
 which schools and colleges often fail to teach, 
 which, as Aristotle well observes, are like a flame 
 of fire light them up in whatever climate you

 and it was saidx bad rendered the Dey s father 
 some important service in an insurrection, and was 
 therefore highly respected ; though at that time he 
 had no public employment. He was an austere 
 man ; his natural severity being probably increas 
 ed by his employment as a military officer. I ne 
 ver saw the face of any person in his family, 
 except the male slaves. The houses of the Alge- 
 rines are nearly all upon the same model, consis 
 ting of a building towards the street of one or two 
 stories, which is occupied by the master and male 
 domestics, and which is connected by a gallery 
 upon the ground, if the house be of one story ;

 of nearly the same size behind, which has no win-

 In these back apartments the women are iougf &amp;lt; ., 
 both wives and slaves. My master had a wife, 
 the daughterof a principle officer in the Dey s court, 
 and to my surprise had on y one. I found it tr 
 be a vulgar error that the Algerines had generally 
 more. It is true they are allowed four by their iaw ; 
 but they generally find, as in our country, one lady 
 sufficient for all the comforts of connubial life, and 
 never take another, except family alliance or bar 
 renness renders it eligible or necessary. The 
 more I became acquainted with their customs, the 
 more was I struck with their great resemblance to 
 the patriarchal manners described in Holy Writ. 
 Concubinage is allowed ; but few respectable peo 
 ple practise it, except for the sake of heirs. With 
 the Algerines the barrenness of RACHEL is some 
 times compensated to the husband by the fertility 
 of a BILHAH. After I had lived in this town- 
 house about three weeks, during which time I 
 \vas clothed after the fashion of the country, my 
 master moved with his whole family to a country- 
 house on the river Saffran. Our journey, which 
 was about twelve miles, was performed in the 
 evening : two carriages resembling our travelling 
 waggons contained the women only that the bo 
 dies of them were latticed, and furnished with cur 
 tains to cover them in the day time, which were 
 rolled up in the evening ; two slaves preceded 
 the carriages ; Abdel Melic followed on horseback, 
 and i accompanied a baggage-waggon in the rear. 
 When we arrived at the country-house, the garden 
 gates were thrown open, and the carriages with 
 the women entered. The men were introduced to

 v . iie front apartments. I found here several more 
 slaves, equally ignorant and equally attentive and 
 kind towards ine as those I had seen in the town. 
 The next day we were all set to work in digging 
 fcr the foundation of a new wall, which was to 
 enlarge our master s gardens. The weather was 
 ^itry. The soil below the surface was almost a 
 quicksand, I, unused to hard labour, found my 
 strength soon exhausted. My fellow slaves, com 
 passionating my distress, were anxious, by chan 
 ging places with me, to render my share of the la- 
 hour less toilsome. As we had our stint for the 
 whole party staked out to us every morning, it was 
 in Ihe power of my kind fellow labourers to fa 
 vour me much. Often would they request me by 
 signs to repose myself in the shade, while they 
 encouraged each s other to perform my share of the 
 task. After a while our master came to inspect 
 the work; and conceiving that it did not advance 
 as fast as he wished, he put an overseer over us, 
 who, finding me not so active as the rest, first 
 threatened and then struck me with his whip. This 
 was the first disgraceful blow I had ever received. 
 Judge you, my gallant freeborn fellow citizens, 
 you who rejoice daily in our federal strength and 
 independence, what were my sensations ! I threw 
 down my spade with disdain, and retired from my 
 work, lowering indignation upon my insulting op 
 pressor. Upon his lifting his whip to strike me 
 agnin, I flew at him, collared him, and threw him 
 on his back. Then setting my foot on his breast, 
 1 called upon my fellow slaves to assist me to bind 
 the wretch, and to make one glorious effort for o-:r

 freedom. But I called in vain. They could net 
 comprehend my language ; and if they could, 1 
 spoke to slaves, astonished at my presunition, ami 
 dreading the consequences for me and themselves, 
 After their first astonishment, they ran and took 
 me gently off from the overseer, and raised him 
 with the greatest respect. No sooner was he upon 
 his feet, than, mad with rage, he took up a mat- 
 toe, and with a violent blow upon my head level 
 led me to the ground, 1 lay senseless, and was 
 awakened from my stupor by the severe lashes of 
 his whip, with which the dastardly wretch continu 
 ed to beat me until his strength failed. 1 was then 
 left to the care of my fellow slaves, who could only 
 wash my wounds with their tears. Complaint was 
 immediately made to my master, and I was sent 
 to work in a stone quarry about two miles from 
 the house. At first 1 rejoiced in escaping the mal 
 ice of this merciless overseer, but soon found 1 had 
 made no advantageous exchange. I was surroun 
 ded by the most miserable objects. My fellow 
 labourers had been put to this place as a punish 
 ment for domestic crimes, or for their superiour 
 strength, and all were obliged to labour equally 
 hard. To break hard rocks with heavy mauls, to 
 transport large stones upon our backs up the crag 
 gy sides of the quarry, were our common labours ; 
 and to drink water, which would have been delici 
 ous if cold, and to eat black barley bread and on 
 ions, our daily fare ; while the few hours allotted 
 to rest upon our flinty beds were disturbed by the 
 tormenting insects, or on my part by the more tor

 .there is a spring under a rock upon my father s

 we used to supply our family with water, and 
 prided ourselves in presenting it as a refreshing

 after working beyond my strength on a sultry Af 
 rican day in that horrid quarry, have 1 dreamt of 
 dipping my cup in that cold spring, and fancied 
 the waters eluding my taste as I raised it to my 
 lips. Being presented with a tumbler filled from 
 this spring, after rny return, in a large circle of 
 friends, the agonies I had suffered came so forcibly 
 into my recollection, that I could not drink the 
 water, but had the weakness to melt into tears.

 parched sands and flinty rocks of Africa that thou 
 taughtest me, that the bread was indeed pleasant, 
 and the water sweet. Let those of our fellow

 A Christian is the highest style of man ; 
 And is there who the blessed cross wipes oil 
 As a foul blot from his dishonour d brow ? 
 If angels tremble, tis at such a sight : 
 The wretch they quit, desponding of their charge.

 ARGUMENT. 
 
 The Author is encountered by a Rencgado &. 
 gles between Faith, the World, the Flesh, and 
 the Devil-. 
 
 As I was drooping under my daily (ask, I saw 
 a young man habited in the Tuikish dress, whose 
 clear skin and florid cheek convinced me he was 
 not a native of the country ; whose mild air and 
 manners betrayed nothing of the ferocity of the 
 renegade. The style of his turban pronounced 
 him a Mahometan ; but the look of pity he cast to 
 wards the Qiristian slaves was entirely inconsis 
 tent with the pious hauteur of the mussulman for 
 Christian dog is expressed as strongly by the fea 
 tures as the tongue of him they call a true believer. 
 He arrested my attention. For a moment I sus 
 pended my labour. At the same moment an un 
 merciful lasli from the whip of the slave-driver re 
 called my attention to my work, and excited his 
 who was the cause of my neglect. At his ap 
 proach the slave-driver quitted me. The stran 
 ger accosted me, and in good English cummisera-

 ted uny distresses, which he ssid, he should deplore 
 the more if they were remediless. When a man 
 is degraded to the most abject slavery, lost to his 
 friends, neglected by his country, and can antici 
 pate no rest but in the grave, is not his situation 
 remediless ? 1 replied. Renounce the Christian, 
 and embrace the Mahometan faith, you are no lon 
 ger a slave, and the delights of life await you, re 
 torted he. You see me. I am an Englishman, 
 For three years after my captivity, like you I 
 groaned under the lash of the slave-driver ; I ate 
 the scanty morsel of bitterness, moistened with my 
 tears. Borne down by the complicated ills of 
 fcunger and severe labour, I was carried to the 
 infirmary for slaves, to breath my last, where I 
 was visited by a mollah, or Mahometan priest. 
 He pitied the misfortunes of a wretch who, he 
 said, had suffered a cruel existence in this life, 
 and had no rational hopes of exchanging it for a 
 better. He opened the great truths of the mussul- 
 man faith. By his assistance 1 recovered my 
 health, and was received among the faithful. Em 
 braced and protected by the rich and powerful, 
 1 have now a house in the city, a country resi 
 dence on the Saffran, two beautitul wives, a train 
 of domestics ; and a respectable place in the Dey s 
 customs defrays the expense. Come, added he, 
 let me send my friend the mollah to you. He will 
 remove your scruples, and in a few days you will 
 be as free and happy as I am. I looked at him 
 with astonishment. I had ever viewed the charac 
 ter of an apostate as odious and detestable. I turn 
 ed from him with abhorrence, and for once embra-

 ced my burthen with pleasure. Indeed I pity* 
 you, said he. I sorrow for your distresses and 
 pity your prejudices. I pity you too, replied I, 
 the tears standing in my eyes. My body is in 
 slavery, but my mind is free. Your body is at 
 liberty, but your soul is in the most abject slavery. 
 in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity. 
 You have sold your God for filthy lucre ; and * wha: 
 shall it profit you if you gain the whole world and 
 lose your own soul ? or what shall a man give in 
 exchange for his soul ?&quot; I respect your prejudices, 
 said the stranger, because I have been subject to 
 them myself. I was born in Birmingham in Eng 
 land, and educated a rigid dissenter. No man is 
 more subject to prejudice than an Englishman, and 
 no sectary more obstinately attached to his tenets 
 than the dissenter. But 1 have conversed with 
 the mollah, and 1 am convinced of the errors of 
 my education. Converse with him likewise. If 
 he does not convince you, you may glory in the 
 Christian faith, as that faith will be then founded 
 on rational preference, and not merely on your ig 
 norance of any other religious system. Suggest 
 the least desire to converse with the mollah, and 
 an order from the mufti will come to your master. 
 You will be clothed and fed at the public expence ; 
 be lodged one month in the college of the priest ; 
 and not returned to your labours, until the priest 
 shall declare you incorrigible. He then left me. 
 The heat increased, and my strength wasted.

 Immediately upon my entering these sacred 
 walls I was carried to a warm bath, into which 
 i was immediately plunged ; while my attendants, 
 as if emulous to cleanse me from all the filth of 
 error, rubbed me so hard with their hands and flesh- 
 brushes, that I verily thought they would have 
 flayed me. While 1 was still in a state of re 
 laxation from the use of the warm bath, I was 
 suddenly plunged into a contiguous cold one. I 
 confess I apprehended dangerous consequences 
 from so sudden a check of such violent perspira* 
 tion ; but I arose from the cold bath highly invig 
 orated.* I was then anointed, in all the parts 
 of my body which had been exposed to the sun, 
 with a preparation of gum, called the balm of 
 Mecca. This application excited a very uneasy 
 sensation, similar to the stroke of the water-pepper 3

 When the profnsest perspiration was thus excited, 
 the patient was carried, and often, with Indian for

 it could be called, which neck had none ; my 
 hands and feet were tinged yellow, with a decoc

 denoted purity of intention. I was lodged and 
 fed well, and suffered to amuse myself and re 
 cover my health of body and mind. On the 
 eleventh day, as I was reclining on the margin of 
 a retired fountain, reflected on my dearnative coun 
 try, I was joined by the mollah. He was a man of 
 about thirty years of age, of the most pleasing 
 countenance and engaging deportment. He was* 
 born at Antioch, and educated a Christian of the 
 Greek church. He was designed by his parents 
 for a preferment in that church, when he was cap 
 tured by the Algerines, and almost immediately 
 conformed to the mussulman faith ; and was hi 
 high esteem in the sacred college of the priests, 
 As he spoke Latin and some modern languages 
 fluently, was well versed in the Bible and Chris 
 tian doctrines, he wit often employed in prosely 
 ting the European slaves, and prided himself ia 
 his frequent success.

 of voice ; kindly inquired after my welfare ; beg 
 ged to know if my lodging, dress, and fare, were

 the fare and modes of my native country, and 
 would give my directions, they should be obeyed. 
 He requested me to appoint a time when we might 
 converse upon the great subject ot religion. He 
 observed that he wished me free from bodily indis 
 position, and that the powers of my mind would 
 recover their activity. He said the holy faith he 
 offered to my embraces disdained the use of other 
 powers than rational argument ; that he left to the 
 church of Rome and its merciless inquisitors all 
 the honour and profit of conversion by faggots, 
 dungeons, and racks. He made some further in 
 quiry as to my usage in the college, and retired. 
 1 had been so long accustomed to the insolence 
 of domestic tyranny ; so often groaned under the 
 whip and burthen ; so often been buffeted, spurned, 
 and spit upon, that I had steeled my mind against 
 the force and terror I anticipated from the mollah ; 
 but was totally unprepared for such apparent can 
 dour and gentleness. Though i viewed his conduct 
 as insidious, yet he no sooner retired, than, over 
 come by his suavity of manners, for the first 
 time ! trembled for my faith, and burst into tears.

 preserve the Freedom of his Mind. 
 
 UPON the margin of a refreshing fountain, shad

 I maintained the sacred truths of our holy religion

 To be more perspicuous, I have condensed our

 have assumed the manner of a dialogue. 
 
 Mollah. Born in New England, my friend, 
 you are a Christian purified by Calvin. Born in 
 the Campania of Rome, you had been a papist. 
 Nursed by the Hindoos, you would have entered 
 the pagoda with reverence, and worshipped the soul 
 of your ancestor in a duck. Educated on the bank of 
 the Wolga, the Delia Lama had been your god. In 
 China you would have worshipped Tien and per 
 fumed Confucius, as you bowed in adoration be 
 fore the tablets of your ancestors. Cradled with

 trembled with pious awe as you presented your 
 rice and your ghee to the adorable cock and dog. 
 
 A wise man adheres not to his religion because 
 it was that of his ancestors. He will examine the 
 creeds of other nations, compare them with his 
 own, and hold fast that which is right. 
 
 Author. You speak well. I will bring my re- - 
 ligion to the test. Compare it with the the 
 
 Mollah. Speak out boldly. No advantage 
 shall be taken. You would say with the Mahom 
 etan imposture. To determine which of two re 
 vealed religions is best, two inquiries are alone 
 necessary. First, which of them has the highest 
 proof of its divine origin ? and which inculcates 
 the purest morals ? that is, of which have we the 
 greatest certainty that it came from God ? and 
 which is calculated to do most good to mankind ? 
 
 Author. True. As to the first point, our Bi 
 ble was written by men divinely inspired. 
 
 Mollah. Our Alcoran was writen by the finger 
 of the Deity himself. But who told you your 
 Bible was written by men divinely inspired ? 
 
 Author. We have received it from our ances 
 tors ; and we have as good evidence for the truths 
 it contains, as we have in profane history for any 
 historical fact. 
 
 Mollah. And so have we for the Alcoran. Our 
 ,sacred and profane writers all prove the existence 
 of such a prophet as Mahomet, that he received 
 the sacred volume from the hand of Gabriel, and 
 the traditions of our ancestors confirm our faith-

 Author. We know that the Christian religion 
 is true, from its small beginnings and wonderful 
 increase. None but the Deity himself could have 
 enabled a few illiterate fishermen to spread a reli 
 gion over the world, and perpetuate it to posterity. 
 
 Mollah. Your argument 1 allow to be forcible, 
 but grant us also the use of it. Mahomet was an 
 illiterate camel-driver. Could he, who could not 
 read or write, have published a book, which for 
 its excellence has astonished the world ? Would 
 the learned of Medina and Mecca have become his 
 disciples ? Could Omer and Abubeker, his suc 
 cessors, men equally illiterate have become the ad 
 miration of the world ? If you argue from the 
 astonishing spread of your faith, .view our prophet, 
 born five hundred and sixty nine years, and dating 
 the promulgation df his doctrine six hundred and 
 twenty years, after the birth of your prophet. 
 See the extensive countries of Persia, Arabia, Syria 
 Egypt, all rejoicing in its benign influence. See 
 our holy failh pouring its divine rays of light into 
 Russia and Tartary. See it received by en 
 lightened Greece, raising its crescent through the 
 rast Turkish empire and the African states. See 
 Palestine and Jerusalem, the birth place of your 
 prophet, filled with the disciples of ours. See 
 Asia and Africa, and a great part of Europe, ac- 
 knowledgeing the unity of God, and the missior* 
 of his prophet. In a word, view the world. See 
 two Mahometans, men professing a religion, 
 which arose six hundred and twenty years after 
 yours, to one Christian, computing Christians of

 of the miraculous spread of religion its due

 My blood boiled to hear this infidel vaunt him 
 self thus triumphantly against my faith ; and, if 
 it had not been for a prudence which in hours of 
 zeal 1 have since had cause to lament, I should 
 have taken vengeance of him upon the spot. I 
 restrained my anger, and observed that our reli 
 gion is supported by miracles. 
 
 Mollah. So is ours ; which is the more re 
 markable, because our great prophet declared he 
 was not sent into the world to work miracles, but 
 to preach the unity of the first cause, the resurrec 
 tion of the dead, the bliss of paradise, and the 
 torments of the damned. Yet his whole life was 
 a miracle. He was no sooner born, than, with a 
 voice like the thundering of Hermon, he pronoun 
 ced the adorable creed to his mother and nurses : 
 / profess that there is only one God, and that I 
 am his apostle. He was circumcised from all 
 eternity : and besides, at the same hour, a voice 
 of four mighty angels was heard proclaiming from 
 the four corners of the holy house ; the first saying, 
 4 Proclaim the truth is risen, and all lies shall 
 return into hell ; the second uttering, Now is 
 born an apostle of your own nation, and the Om 
 nipotent is with him ; the words of the third 
 were, A book full of illustrious light is sent to 
 you from God ; and the fourth voice was heard 
 to say, O Mahomet, we have sent thee to be a 
 prophet, apostle, and guide to the world! 
 
 When the apostle of God was about three 
 years old, the blessed child retired into a cave at

 the foot of mount Uriel, where the archangel Ga 
 briel, covering his face with his wings, in awful 
 respect approached him, saying, Bismillahi Rrah- 
 mani Rrhahimi ; in the name of the one Almigh 
 ty, Compassionate, and Merciful, I am sent to 
 pluck from thy heart the root of evil ; for thy 
 prayers have shaken the pillars of eternal decree. 
 The infant prophet said, The will of thy Lord 
 and mine be done. The archangel then opened 
 his bosom with a lancet of adamant, and taking 
 out his heart, squeezed from it the black drop of 
 original sin ; and having restored the heart, sunk 
 gently into the bosom of the Houri. 
 
 Do you wish for more miracles ? Hear how the 
 prophet, in the dark night, passed the seven heav 
 ens upon the sacred mule ; of the mighty angel 
 he saw, of such astonishing magnitude that it was 
 twelve thousand days journey in the space be 
 tween his eye-brows ; of the years he spent in 
 perusing the book of destiny ; and how he return 
 ed so speedily, that the mattress was not cold, and 
 he recovered the pitcher at his bed-side, which 
 he had overset at his departure, so that not one 
 drop of water was lost. Contrast these with 
 those of your prophet. He then vented a volume 
 of reproach horrible to hear, and too blasphemous 
 to defile my paper. 
 
 Author. Our religion was disseminated in 
 peace ; yours was promulgated by the sword. 
 
 Mollah. My friend, you surely have not read 
 the writings of your own historians. The history 
 of the Christian church is a detail of bloody 
 nsassacre ; from the institution of the Christian

 (o the expulsion of the Moors out of Spain by 
 the ferocious inquisition, or the dragooning of the 
 Hugonots from France under Louis the Great. 
 The Massulmans never yet forced a man to adopt 
 their faith. When Ahubeker the caliph took a 
 Christian city, he forebore to enter a principal 
 church, because he would be led to pray in any 
 temple dedicated to God ; ^nd wherever he pray 
 ed, the building would be established as a mosque 
 by the piety of the faithful. The companions 
 and successors of the apostle conquered cities and 
 kingdoms, like other nations. They gave civil 
 laws to the conquered, according to the laws of 
 nations ; but they never forced the conscience of 
 any man. It is true, they then, and we now, when 
 a slave pronounces the ineffable creed, immedi 
 ately knock off his fetters and receive him as a 
 brother ; because we read in the book of Zuni 
 that the souls of true believers are bound up in 
 one fragrant bundle of eternal love. We leave 
 it to the Chistians of the West Indies, and Chris 
 tians of your southern plantations, to baptise the 
 unfortunate African into your faith, and then use 
 your brother Christians as brutes of the desert. 
 
 Here I was so abashed for my country, I could 
 not answer him. 
 
 Jluthor. But you hold a sensual paradise. 
 
 Mdlah. So the doctors of your church tell

 guage, it nuj3t be in terms commensurate with our

 conception. The enjoyment of the houri, those 
 immortal virgins who will attend the beautified be 
 liever, (he splendid pavilious of the heavens, are 
 all but types and significations of holy joys too 
 sublime for man in flesh to conceive of. In your 
 Bible, I read, your prophet refers to the time when 
 he should drink new wine in his father s kingdom/ 
 Now would it be candid in me to hastily brand the 
 heaven of your prophet as sensual, and to repre 
 sent your faithful in bliss as a club of wine-bib 
 bers ? 
 
 Author. But you will allow the pre-eminence 
 of the morality of the sacred Scriptures. 
 
 Mollah. Your Scriptures contain many excel 
 lent rules of life. You are there taught to be 
 kindly affectionate one towards another ; but they 
 recommend the u$e of wine, and do not forbid 
 gaming. The Alcoran, by forbidding in express 
 terms the use of either, cuts from its follower the 
 two principal sources of disquiet and misery. 
 Read then this spotless book. There you will 
 learn to love those of our faith, and not hate those 
 of any other. You will learn the necessity of 
 being virtuous here, that you may be happy and 
 not miserable hereafter. You will learn resigna 
 tion to the will of the Holy One ; because you 
 will know that all the events of your life were, in 
 the embryo of time, forged on the anvils of Di 
 vine Wisdom. In a word, you will learn the uni 
 ty of God, which, notwithstanding the cavil of 
 your divines, your prophet, like ours, came into 
 the world to establish, and every msn of reason

 good a mussulman as to have rejoiced in my con 
 version, though it might affect his purse. I expe 
 rienced the extremest contumely and severity ; but 
 I was never branded as a heretic. I had by this 
 time acquired some knowledge of their language, 
 if language it could be called, which bade defiance 
 to moods and tenses, appearing to be the shreds- 
 and clippings of all the tongues, dead and living, 
 ever spoken since the creation. It is well known 
 on the sea-coasts of the Mediterranean by the 
 name of Lingua Franca. Probably it had its rise 
 in the aukward endeavours of the natives to con 
 verse with strangers from all parts of the world ; 
 aud the vulgar people, calling all foreigners Franks, 
 supplied its name. I the more readily acquired 
 this jargon, as it contained many Latin derivatives, 
 If 1 have conjectured the true principles upon 
 which the Lingua Franca was originally formed, 
 that principle is still applied through all stages of 
 its existence. Every person assumes a right to 
 introduce words and phrases from his vernacular 
 tongue, and with some alteration in accent they 
 are readily adopted.* 
 
 This medley of sounds is spoken by the vul

 composition of boiled barley, rice, and treacle, I cal- 
 Ifed for the hasty fiudding and molasses. The 
 phrase was immediately adopted ; and haschi fiudah 
 molaschi is now a synonima with the ancient name. 
 And I doubt not, if a dictionary of the Lingua 
 Franca shall ever be compiled, the name of the

 cuous place.

 the labour and hard fare seemed, if possible, to 
 be augmented. The ease and comfort with which 
 I lived for some weeks past had vitiated my 
 appetite, softened my hands, and relaxed my 
 whole frame, so that my coarse fare and rugged 
 labours seemed more insupportable. I nauseated 
 our homely food, and the skin peeled from my 
 hands and shoulders. I made what inquiries f 
 could as to the interior geography of the coun 
 try, and comforted myself with the hope of es 
 cape ; conceiving it, under my desperate cir 
 cumstances, possible to penetrate unobserved the 
 interior country by the eastern boundaries of the 
 kingdom of Morocco, and then pass on south 
 west until I met the river Sanaga, as cour 
 sing that to its mouth I knew would bring me 
 to some of the European settlements near Go- 
 ree of Cape Verd. Preparatory to my intended 
 escape I had procured an old goat s skin, to 
 make which into something like a knapsack I 
 deprived myself of many hours of necessary 
 sleep, and of many a scanty meal to fill it with 
 provisions. By the use of my Lingua Franca 
 and a little Arabic, I hoped to obtain the as 
 sistance of the slaves and lower orders of the 
 people through whom I might journey. The on

 to elude the vigilance of our overseers. By a 
 kind of roll-call the slaves were numbered every 
 night and morning, and at meal times : but, very

 unnoticed soon offered. It was announced to the 
 slaves that in three days tinae there would be a

 day of rest, a holiday, when they would be al 
 lowed to recreate themselves in the fields. This 
 intelligence diffused general joy. I received it 
 with rapture. I doubled my diligence in my 
 preparations ; and, in the afternoon previous to 
 this fortunate day, I contrived to place my lit 
 tle stock of provisions under a rock at a small 
 distance from the quarry. At sunset we were 
 all admitted to bathe, and 1 retired to my re 
 pose with bright hopes of freedom in my heart, 
 which were succeeded by the most pleasing 
 dreams of my native land. That beneficent Be 
 ing who brightens the slumbers of the wretched 
 with rays of bliss can alone express my raptures, 
 when, in the visions of that night, I stepped 
 lightly over a father s threshold, was surrounded 
 by congratulating friends and faithful domestics, 
 was pressed by the embraces of a father, and with 
 holy joy lelt a mother s tears moisten my cheek. 
 Early in the dawn of the morning, I was awa 
 kened by the congratulations of my fellows, who 
 immediately collected in small groups, planning 
 out the intended amusements of the day. Scarce 
 had they portioned the little space allotted to ease 
 according to their various inclinations, when an ex 
 press order came from our master that we should 
 go, under immediate direction of our overseers, to 
 a plain, about five miles distance, to be present 
 at a public spectacle. This was a grievous dis 
 appointment to them, and more especially to me. 
 I buoyed up my spirits however with the hopes 
 that in the hurry and crowd 1 might find means to 
 escape, which although I knew I could not return

 WE were soon paraded, and reached to the plain 
 to be amused with the promised spectacle, which, 
 notwithstanding it might probably frustrate my at 
 tempts for freedom, I anticipated with a pleasing 
 curiosity. When we arrived at the plain, we 
 found surrounding a spot fenced in wiih a slight 
 railing, a large concourse of people, among whom 
 I could discern many groups of men, whose ha 
 bits arid sorrow-indented faces showed them to be 
 of the same miserable order with us. In the midot 
 of this spot there was a frame erected, somewhat 
 resembling the stage of our pillories ; on the centre 
 of which a pole or strong stake was erected, sharp 
 ened at the end, and pointed with steel. While I was 
 perplexing myself with the design of this appara 
 tus, military music was heard at a distance .; and 
 soon after a strong party of guards approached the 
 scaffold, and soon mounted upon the stage a mis 
 erable wretch, with all the agonies of despair in

 his countenance, who, I learned from his sentence 
 proclaimed by a public crier, was to be empaled 
 alive for attempting to escape from bondage. The 
 consciousness that I had been, one moment before, 
 meditating the same act for which this wretch was 
 to suffer so cruelly, added to my feelings for a fel 
 low creature, excited so strong a sympathy for the 
 devoted wretch, that 1 was near fainting. 
 
 I will not wound the sensibility of my human 
 fellow citizens by a minute detail of this fiend-hke 
 punishment. Suffice it to say, that, after they had 
 stripped the sufferer naked, except a cloth around 
 the loins, they inserted the iron pointed stake in 
 to the lower termination of the vertebrae, and thence 
 forced it up near his back bone until it appeared 
 between his shoulders, with devilish ingenuity con- 
 contriving to avoid the vital parts. The slake 
 was then raised into the air, and the suffering 
 wretch exposed to the view of the assembly, wn- 
 thincr in all the contortions of insupportable agony* 
 Hovv long he lived I cannot tell ; I never gave but 
 one look at him : one was enough to appal a 
 New-England heart. I laid my head on the rails 
 until we &quot;retired. It was now obvious it was de- 
 &amp;lt;=ie;ned by our master that this horrid spectacle 
 should operate upon us as a terrifying example. 
 It had its full effect on me. I thought no more 
 of attempting an escape; but, during our return 
 was miserably tormented lest my knapsack and 
 provisions should be found and adduced against me, 
 as ^vidence of my intent to desert. Happily for 
 me I recovered them the next day, and no suspi= 
 cions of my design were entertained,

 I NOW found that 1 was indeed a slave. My body 
 had been enthralled, but the dignity of a free 
 mind remained ; and the same insulted pride, 
 which had impelled me to spurn the villain slave- 
 driver who first struck me a disgraceful blow, had 
 often excited a surly look of contempt upon my 
 master and the vile instruments of his oppression ; 
 but the terror of the late execution, with the un- 
 abating fatigue of my body, had so depressed my 
 fortitude, that I trembled at the look of the over 
 seer, and was meanly anxious to conciliate his fa 
 vour by attempting personal exertions beyond my 
 ability. The trite story of the insurgent army 
 of the slaves of ancient Rome being routed by the 
 mere menaces and whips of their masters, which 
 I had ever sceptically received, 1 now credited.

 it deeply engraven upon their memories, that when

 Depression of spirits consequent upon my blast

 exertion brought on an hemoptysis, or expectora

 practice. But it was immaterial to me ; I had 
 cast my last anxious thoughts upon my dear native 
 land, had blessed my affectionate parents, and was 
 resigned to die. 
 
 One day, as I was sunk upon my bed after a 
 violent fit of coughing, I was awakened from a 
 doze by a familiar voice which accosted me in 
 Latin. 1 opened my eyes, and saw at my side 
 the mollah who attempted to destroy my faith. 
 It immediately struck me that his purpose was to 
 tempt me to apostatize in my last moments. The 
 religion of my country was all 1 had left of the 
 many blessings I once enjoyed in common with 
 my fellow citizens. This rendered it doubly dear 
 to me. Not that I was insensible of the excel 
 lence and verity of my faith ; no. If I had 
 been exposed to severer agonies than I suffered, 
 and had been flattered with all the riches and hon 
 ours these infidels could bestow, I trust I should 
 never have foregone that faith, which assured me, 
 for the miseries I sustained in a cruel separation 
 from my parents, friends, and under intolerable 
 slavery, a rich compensation in that future world, 
 where I should rejoin my beloved friends, and 
 where sorrow, misery, or slavery, should never 
 come, I judged uncandidly of the priest. He 
 accosted me with the same gentleness as when at 
 the college, commiserated my deplorable situation, 
 and, upon my expressing an aversion to talk upon 
 religion, assured me that he disdained taking any 
 advantage of my weakness ; nor would attempt 
 to deprive me of the consolation of my faith ? 
 when he feared I had no time left to ground

 a better. He recommended me to the particular 
 care of the religious, who attended the sick in the 
 hospital ; and having learned in our former con 
 ferences that I was educated a physician, he in 
 fluenced his friend the director of the infirmary 
 to purchase me, if I regained my health, and told 
 him I should be serviceable as a minor assistant. 
 If any man could have effected a change of 
 my religion, it was this priest. I was charmed 
 with the man, though I abominated his faith. His 
 very smile exhilarated my spirits and infused 
 health ; and, when he repeated his visits, and 
 communicated his plans of alleviating my distres 
 ses, the very idea of being freed from the oppres 
 sions of Abdel Melic made an exchange of slavery 
 appear desirable. I was again attached to life, 
 and requested him to procure a small quantity of 
 the quinquina, or Jesuit s bark. This excellent 
 : ciiic was unknown in the infirmary ; but as 
 \lgerines are all fatalists, it is immaterial to 
 the patient who is his physician and what he pre 
 scribes. By his kindness the bark was procured, 
 and I made a decoction, as near to Huxham s as 
 the ingredients I could procure would admit, which 
 1 infused in wine ; no brandy being allowed even 
 lor the sick. In a few weeks the diagnostics were 
 favourable, and I recovered my pristine health ; 
 and soon after the director of the hospital purchas

 to the care of the medicine room, with permission 
 to go into the city for fresh supplier

 The Author s Practice as a Surgeon and Physician 
 in the City of Algiers. 
 
 MY circumstances were now so greatly ameliora 
 ted, that if I could have been assured of returning 
 to my native country in a few years, I should have 
 esteemed them eligible. To observe the customs, 
 habits, and manners, of a people of whom so 
 much is said and so little known at home, and 
 especially to notice the medical practice of a na 
 tion whose ancestors have been spoken of with 
 respect in the annals of the healing art, was high 
 ly interesting. 
 
 After a marked and assiduous attention of some 
 months to the duties of my office, I acquired the 
 confidence of my superiors so far, that I was some 
 times sent abroad in the city to examine a patient, 
 who had applied for admission into the infirmary ; 
 and sometimes the physicians themselves would 
 condescend to consult me. Though they affected 
 to despise my skill, I had often the gratification 
 of observing that they administered my prescrip 
 tions with success.

 In surgery they were arrant bunglers. Indeed, 
 their pretensions to knowledge in this branch were 
 so small, that iny superior adroitness scarcely oc 
 casioned envy. Applications, vulgarly common 
 in the United States, were there viewed with ad 
 miration. The actual cautery was their only 
 method of staunching an external haemorrhage. 
 The first amputation I operated drew all the prin 
 cipal physicians around me. Nothing could equal 
 their surprise at the application of the spring tour 
 niquet, which I had assisted a workman to make 
 for the occasion, except the taking up of the arte 
 ries. My friend the mollah came to congratulate 
 me on my success, and spread my reputation 
 wherever he visited. A poor creature was brought 
 to the hospital with a depressed fracture upon the 
 os frontis, sunk into a lethargy, and died. I pro 
 posed trepanning, but found those useful instru 
 ments unknown in this country. By the care of 
 the director, I had a set made under my direction ; 
 but, after having performed upon a dead, I never 
 could persuade the Algerine faculty to permit me 
 to operate upon a living, subject. What was 
 more amusing, they pretended to improve the aid 
 of philosophy against me, and talked of the weight 
 of a column of air pressing upon the dura mater, 
 which, they said, would cause instant death. Of 
 all follies, the foppery of learning is the most in 
 supportable. Professional ignorance and obstina 
 cy were not all I had to contend with ; religious 
 prejudice was a constant impediment to my sue* 
 cess. The bigotry of the Mahometan differs es- 
 .sentially from that of the Roman-catholic. The

 former is a passive, the latter an active, principle,. 
 The papist will burn infidels and heretics ; theMus- 
 sulman never torments the unbeliever, but is more 
 tenaciously attached to his own creed, makes his 
 faith- a principle in life, and never suffers doubt to 
 disturb or reason to overthrow it. I verily believe 
 that if the Alcoran had declared that the earth was 
 an immense plain and stood still, while the sun 
 performed its revolution round it, a whole host of 
 Gallileos, with a Newton at their head, could not 
 have shaken their opinion, though aided by all the 
 demonstrative powers of experimental philosophy, 
 I was invited by one of the faculty to inspect 
 the eyes of a child which had lost its sight about 
 three years ; I proposed couching, and operated 
 on the right eye with success. This child was 
 the only son of an opulent Algerine, who, being 
 informed that an infidel had restored his son to 
 sight, refused to let me operate on the other, pro 
 testing that if he had known that the operator was 
 an unbeliever, his son should have remained blind 
 until he opened his eyes upon the houri of para 
 dise. He sent me however a present of money, 
 and offered to make my fortune if I would abjure 
 the Christian faith and embrace Ismaelism, which, 
 he said, he believed I should one day do : as he 
 thought that God never would have decreed that I 
 should restore his son to sight, if he had not also 
 decreed that 1 should be a true believer.

 Visits a sick Lady. 
 
 MY reputation increased, and I was called the 
 learned slave ; and soon after sent for to visit a 
 sick lady. This was very agreeable to me ; for, 
 during my whole captivity, I had never yet seen 
 the face of a woman ; even the female children 
 being carefully concealed, at least from the sight 
 of the vulgar. I now anticipated much satisfac 
 tion from this visit, and hoped that through the 
 confidence with which a tender and successful 
 physician seldom fails to inspire his patient, I 
 should be able to acquire much useful information 
 upon subjects of domestic concern, impervious 
 to travellers. Prepararory to this visit I had 
 received a new and better suit of clothes than I 
 had worn, as a present from the father of the

 voting lady. A gilt waggon came to the gate 
 of the hospital, which I entered with our princi 
 pal physician, and was drawn by mules to a 
 country-house about five miles from the city, vyhere 
 I was received by Hadgi Mulladin, the father of 
 my patient, with great civility : real gentlemen 
 are the same in all countries. He treated us 
 with fruit and sherbet ; and smiling upon me 
 after he had presented a bowl of sherbet to the 
 principal physician, he handed me another bowl, 
 which, to my surprise, 1 found filled with an 
 excellent Greek wine, and archly inquired of mo 
 how I liked the sherbet* Hadgi Mulladin had 
 travelled in his youth, and was supposed to have 
 imbibed the libertine principles of the Chris 
 tian as it respected wine. This was the only 
 instance which came to rny knowledge of any 
 professed Mussulman indulging himself with wine 
 or any strong liquor ; and it was not unnoticed 
 by the principal physician, who afterwards grave 
 ly told me that Hadgi Mulladin would be undoubt 
 edly damned for drinking wine ; would be con 
 demned to perpetual thirst in the next world, 
 while the black spirit would present him with red 
 hot cups of scalding wine. Exhilarated by the 
 wine and the comparatively free manners of this 
 Algerine, 1 was anxious to see my patient. I 
 was soon gratified. Being introdced into a large 
 room, I was left alone nigh an hour. A side door 
 was then opened, and two eunuchs came forward 
 with much solemnity and made signs for me to 
 retire to the farthest part of the room, as if I had 
 been infested with some malignant disorder ~

 They were, in about ten minutes, followed by 
 four more persons of the same description, bear 
 ing a species of couch close covered with double 
 curtains of silk, which they set down in the midst 
 of the room ; and every one drew a broad scyme- 
 tar from his belt, flourished it in the air, inclined 
 it over his shoulder, and stood guard at every cor 
 ner of the couch. While I was wondering at this 
 parade, the two first eunuchs retired and soon re 
 turned ; the one bearing an ewer or bason of wa 
 ter, the other a low marble stand and some nap 
 kins in a China dish. I was then directe d to 
 wash my feet ; and another bason being produced, 
 it was signified that I must wash my hands, which 
 I did three times. A large thick muslin veil was 
 then thrown over my head, I was led towards the 
 couch, and was presented with a pulse glass, 
 being a long glass tube graduated and ter 
 minated below with a hollow bulb, and filled 
 with some liquid, which rose and fell like spir 
 its in the thermometer. This instrument was 
 inserted through the curtains, and the bulb applied 
 to the pulse of my patient, and the other extrem 
 ity put under iny veil. By this I was to form 
 my opinion of her disorder and prescribe a re 
 medy ; for I was not allowed to ask any questions, 
 or even to speak to, much more see, the lady, 
 who was soon re-conveyed to her apartment. The 
 two first eunuchs now marched in the rear, and 
 closed and fastened the doors carefully after them. 
 After waiting alone two hours or more, I was 
 called to give my advice ; and never was I more 
 puzzled. To confess ignorance would have ruin~_

 ed my reputation, and reputation was then life 
 itself. The temptations to quackery were power 
 ful, and overcame me. I boldly pronounced her 
 disease to be an intermittent fever, prescribed 
 venesection, and exhibited some common febri 
 fuge, with directions to throw in the bark when 
 the fever ceased. My prescriptions were atten 
 ded with admirable success ; and, if I had con 
 formed to their faith, beyond a doubt I might 
 have acquired immense riches. But I was a 
 slave, and all my gains were the property of 
 my master. 1 must do him the justice to say 
 that he permitted me to keep any particular pres 
 ents that were made to me. Frequent applications 
 were made to the director for my advice and as 
 sistance to the diseased ; and though he received 
 generally my fee, yet it was sufficiently gratifying 
 to me to be pesmitted to walk abroad, to amuse 
 myself, and obtain, information of this extraordin 
 ary people, as much of which as the prescribed 
 limits of this little work will admit I shall now lay

 The history of nations, like the biography of 
 man, assumes an interesting importance only when 
 Us subject is matured into vigour. To trace the 
 infancy of the old world, we run into childish 
 prattle and boyish tales. Suffice it then to say, 
 that the mixed multitudes which inhabited[this coun 
 try were reduced to the subjection of the Greek 
 emperors by the arms of the celebrated Belisarius, 
 and so continued until the close of the seventh 
 century, when they were subdued by the invinci 
 ble power, and converted to the creed of the an 
 cient caliphs, the immediate successors of the pro 
 phet Mahomet, who parcelled the country into 
 many subordinate governments. One of these 
 states is Algiers ; which is bounded on the north 
 by the Mediterranean ; on the south by mount 
 Atlas so familiar to the classic reader and the 
 chain of hills which extends thence to the north 
 east ; on (he west by the kingdom of Morocco*; 
 and on the east by the state of Tunis. The state 
 of Algiers is about five hundred miles in length

 It was nine hundred years after its conquest bv 
 the caliphs, and at the beginning of the tenth cen 
 tury, that the Algerines, by becoming formidable 
 to the Europeans, acquired the notice of the en- 
 lightened historian. About this time, two enter 
 prising young men, sons of a potter of the island 
 of 3Iytelene, the ancient Lesbos, called Horric 
 and Hayraddin, collecting a number of despera 
 does, seized upon a brigantine and commenced 
 pirates, making indiscriminate depredations upon 
 the vessels of all nations. They soon augmented 
 their force to a fleet of twelve galleys, besides 
 small craft, with which they infested the sea-coast 
 of Spain and Italy, and carried their booty into 
 the ports 6f Barbary, styling themselves the 
 lords of the sea, and the enemies of all those who 
 sailed upon it. European nations were not then 
 possessed of such established and formidable na 
 vies as at the present day : even the English, 
 who seem formed for the command of the sea, had 
 but few ships of force. Henry the Eighth built 
 some vessels, which, from their unmanageable bulk, 
 were rather suited for home defence than foreign 
 enterprize ; and the fleet of Elizabeth, which, in 
 1588, destroyed the Spanish armada, was princi 
 pally formed of ships chartered by the merchant-, 
 who were the general resource of all the maritime

 powers. The fleet of these adventurers was there 
 fore formidable ; and, as Robertson says, soon be 
 came terrible from the Straits of the Dardanelles 
 *o those of Gibraltar. The prospects of ambition 
 increase as man ascends its summit. Horric, 
 the elder brother, surnamed Barbarossa,, as some 
 assert, from the red colour of his beard, aspired 
 to the attainment of sovereign power upon land ; 
 and a favourable opportunity soon offered of grati 
 fying his pride. His frequent intercourse with 
 ;be Barbary states induced an acquaintance with 
 Kutimi, then king of Algiers, who was at war 
 with Spain, and had made several unsuccessful at- 
 Jacks upon a small fort built by that nation on the 
 Oran, in his distress, this king inconsiderately ap 
 plied to Barbarossa for assistance, who readily 
 embraced the invitation, and conducted himself 
 like more modern allies. He first assisted this 
 tveak king against his enemy, and then sacrificed 
 Jiim to his own ambition ; for, leaving his brother 
 liayraddin to command the fleet, he entered the 
 city of Algiers at the head of five thousand men, 
 was received by the inhabitants as their deliverer, 
 assisted them against the Spaniards, and then ar 
 rested and disarmed the principle people, secretly 
 murdered the unsuspecting Eutimi, and caused 
 himself to be proclaimed king of Algiers. Lavish 
 oi his treasures to his adherants, and cruelly vin 
 dictive to those he distrusted, he not only estab 
 lished his government, but dethroned the neighbour

 the capitol of that kingdom, where this ferocious 
 adventurer was slain in attempting his escape, but 
 fought his pursuers with a brutal rage becoming 
 the ferocity of his life. Upon the death of Bar- 
 barossa, his brother Hayraddin assumed the same 
 name and the kingdom of Algiers. This Barba- 
 rossa, is better known to the European annalist 
 for rendering his dominions tributary to the grand 
 seignior* He enlarged his power with a body of the 
 Turkish soldiers ; and, being promoted to the 
 command of the Turkish fleet, he spread the fame 
 of the Ottoman power through all Europe : for, 
 though obliged by the superior power of the em 
 peror Charles the Fifth to relinquish his conquest 
 of Tunis, which he had effected by a similar 
 treachery with which his brother had posessed 
 himself of Algiers, yet his being the acknowledg 
 ed rival of Andrew Doria, the first sea command 
 er of his age, has laurelled his brow among those 
 who esteem glory to consist in carnage. This 
 Barbarossa built a mole for the protection of the 
 harbour of Algiers, in which, it is said, he em 
 ployed thirty thousand Christian slaves :. he died 
 a natural death, and was succeeded by Hassan 
 Aga, a renegado from Sirdinia, elected by the sol- 
 dies, but confirmed by the grand seignior ; who, 
 taking advantage of a violent storm which wreck

 had invaded his territories, drove that proud em-&quot;

 i.uy, and captured so many of his soldiers, that the 
 Algerines, it is reported, sold many of their pris 
 oners, by way of contempt, at the price of an on 
 ion per head. Another Hassan, son to the se 
 cond Barbarossa, succeeded, and defeated the 
 Spaniards, who invaded his dominions under the 
 command of the count de Alcandara, killed that 
 nobleman, and took about twelve thousand prison 
 ers. But his successor Mahomet merited most the 
 thanks of his conntry, when, by ingratiating him 
 self with the Turkish soldiers, and by incorpora 
 ting them with his own troops, he annihilated the 
 contests of these fierce rivals, formed a permanent 
 body of brave disciplined troops, and enabled his 
 successor to renounce that dependence upon the 
 grand seignior, to which the second Barbarossa, 
 fcad submitted. 
 
 In 1609, the^Algerines received a vast accession 
 of strength and numbers from the emigrant Moors, 
 \vhom the weak policy of Spain had driven to 
 their dominions. Embittered by Christian severi 
 ty, the Moors flocked on board the Algerine vessels, 
 and sought a desperate revenge upon all who bore 
 the Christian name. Their fleet was said to con 
 sist at this period of upwards of forty ships, from 
 two to four hundred tons burthen. Though the 
 French, with that gallantry which distinguished 
 them under their monarchs, undertook to avenge 
 the cause of Europe and Christianity ; and, in 
 3617, sent a fleet of fifty ships of war against

 the treaties made by the grand seignior, seizing the 
 ships of those powers with which he was in alli 
 ance, even in his own ports ; and, after plundering 
 Scandaroon in Syria, an Ottoman city, they, in 
 1623, threw off their dependence on the Sublime 
 Porte. In 1637, the Algerine rovers entered 
 the British channel, and made so many captures 
 that it was conjectured near five thousand English 
 were made prisoners by them ; and, in the same 
 year, they dispatched Hali Pinchinin with sixteen 
 galleys to rob the rich chapel of Our Lady of 
 Loretto ; which proving unsuccessful, they ravaged 
 the scores of the Adriatic, and so enraged the Ven 
 etians, that they fitted out a fleet of twenty-eight 
 sail under the command of admiral Cappello, who, 
 by a late treaty with the Porte, had liberty to en 
 ter any of its harbours to destroy the Algerine gal 
 leys. Cappello was ordered by the Venetians to 
 sink, burn, and destroy, without . mercy, all the 
 corsairs of the enemy, and he bravely and sus- 
 cessfully executed his commisson. He immediate 
 ly overtook and defeated Pinchinin, disabled five 
 of his galleys ; and this Algerine retreating to 
 Valona and landing his booty, where he erected 
 batteries for its defence, the brave Cappello man

 wjiole fleet. In these actions about twelve hun 
 dred Algerines were slain ; and what was more* 
 pleasing, sixteen hundred Christian gaily-slave:^ 
 set at liberty. History affords no instance of a

 Josses as the Algerines. Within a few years we 
 &nd them fitting out seventy sail of armed vessels, 
 and making such daring and desperate attacks up 
 on the commerce of nations, that the most haughty 
 maritime powers of Europe were more anxious to 
 shelter themselves under a treaty, and pay an hu 
 miliating tribute, than to attempt nobly to reduce 
 them to reason and humanity. But, after many 
 ineffectual attempts bad deen made to uniler the 
 force of Europe against them, the gallant French 
 by the command of Lewis the Fourteenth, again 
 roused themselves to chastise this intractable race. 
 In 1682, the marquis du Quesne with a large fleet 
 and several bomb-ketches, reached Algiers ; and 
 with sea-mortars bombarded it so violently, that 
 he laid almost the whole city in ruins. Whether 
 his orders went no further, or the vice-admiral 
 judged he had chastised them sufficiently, or wheth 
 er a violent storm drove his fleet from its moorings, 
 does not appear. But it is certain that he left the 
 c\iy abruptly, and the Algerines-, to revenge this 
 insult, immediately sent their fleet to the coast ot 
 France, and took signal reparation. 
 
 The next year du Quesne cast anchor before Al 
 giers with a large fleet ; and for forty-eight hours 
 made such deadly discharges with his cannon, and 
 showered so many bombs over this devoted city, 
 that the dey sued for peace. 
 
 The French admiral, with that generosity which 
 is peculiar to his nation, insisted, as an indispen 
 sable preliminary, that all the Christian slaves 
 should be sent on board his squadron, with Mez- 
 emorto, the dey s admiral, as a hostage for the

 performance of this preliminary article. The dej 
 assembled his divan, or council of great officers, 
 and communicated the French demands. Mez* 
 emorto immediately collected the sailors who had 
 manned the ramparts, and with whom he was a 
 favourite ; and, accusing the dey of cowardice, he 
 so inflamed them, that, being joined by the sol 
 diers, they murdered the dey, and elected Mez- 
 emorto in his stead. This was a signal for re 
 newed hostility, and never was there a scene of 
 greater carnage. The French seemed to have 
 reserved their fire for this moment, when thej 
 poured such incessant volleys of red-hot shot, bombs, 
 and carcasses, into the city, that it was nearly all 
 in flames. The streets run blood, while the 
 politic and furious Mezemorto, dreading a change 
 in the public mind, and conscious that another 
 cessation of arms would be attended with his 
 death or delivery to the French, ran furiously 
 round the ramparts, and exhorted the military to 
 their duty, and to make his new subjects despe 
 rate caused all the French slaves to be murdered ; 
 and seizing the French consul, who had been 
 a prisoner among them since the first declaration 
 of war, he ordered him to be tied hand and foot,

 the air towards the French fleet. The French were 
 s.o highly enraged that the sailors could scarcely 
 be prevented from attempting to land and des 
 troy this barbarous race. The vice-admiral con 
 tented himself with levelling their fortifications, 
 reducing the city to rubbish, and burning their

 preveriting the Algerines from again molesting 
 commerce. If the European maritime powers 
 had by treaty engaged themselves to destroy the 
 first armed galley of the Algerines which appear 
 ed upon the seas, and conjointly forbidden them 
 to repair their fortifications, this people might ere 
 now have from necessity turned their attention to 
 commerce ; the miscreants and outcasts of other 
 nations would have no longer found refuge among 
 them ; and the state at this time might have been 
 as celebrated for the peaceful arts as they are. odi 
 ous for the constant violation of the laws of nations 
 and humanity. This was surely the common inter 
 est of the European powers ; but to talk of their 
 common interest is idle. The narrow politics of 
 Europe seek an individual not a common good ; for 
 no sooner had France humbled the Algerines than 
 England thought it more for her interest to enter 
 into a treaty with the new dey, and, by way oi 
 douceur, sent to Algiers a ship load of naval and 
 military stores, to help them to rebuild their navy 
 and strengthen their fortresses ; while France, 
 jealous lest the affections of the monster Mezemor 
 to, who barbarously murdered their fellow-citizens, 
 should be attached to her rivals the English, im 
 mediately patched up a peace with the Algerines 
 upon the most favourable terms to the latter ; and 
 to conclude the farce, sent them another ship Ioav4 
 of similar materials and of superior value to those 
 presented by the English. This, my readers, i* 
 a small specimen of European policy.

 on the Algerines was, cm thu 23x1 of June, 1775. ;

 when the Spaniards sent the count O Reilly with 
 a respectable fleet, twenty-four thousand land for 
 ces, and a prodigious train of artillery, to destroy 
 the city. The count landed two-thirds of his 
 troops about a league and a half to the eastward 
 of the city ; but upon marching into the country 
 they were opposed by an immense army of na 
 tives. The Spaniards say it consisted of one hun 
 dred and fifty thousand probably exaggerated by 
 their apprehensions. This is certain, they had 
 force sufficient or superior skill, to defeat the Span 
 iards, who retreated to their ships with the loss of 
 thirteen cannon, some howitzers, and three thou 
 sand killed, besides prisoners ; while they des 
 troyed six thousand Algerines. No sooner had 
 the treaty of Paris, in 1782, completely liberated 
 the United States from their dependence upon the 
 British nation, than that haughty exasperated pow

 that protection under which their vessels had here 
 tofore navigated the Mediterranean, excited the

 Description of the City of Algiers. 
 
 I CANNOT give so particular a description of this 
 city as I could wish or my readers may desire.. 
 Perhaps no town contains so many places imper 
 vious to strangers. The interior of the dey s pal 
 ace, and the female apartment of every house, 
 are secluded even from the natives. No one ap 
 proaches them but their respective masters ; while 
 no stranger is permitted to inspect the fortifica 
 tions ; and the mosques, or churches, are scrupu 
 lously guarded from the polluted steps of the un 
 believer. A poor slave, branded as an infidel, 
 would obtain only general information from a ro 
 sidence in the midst of them.

 Algiers is situated in a bay of that name, and 
 built upon the sea-shore, and on an eminence which 
 rises above it, and which naturally gives the dis 
 tinction of the upper and lower city. Towards 
 the sea it is strengthened with vast fortifications, 
 which are continued upon the mole which secures 
 the port from storms and assaults. I never per 
 ambulated it, but should judge that a line drawn 
 irom the west arm of the mole, and extended by 
 land until it terminated on the east, comprehend 
 ing the buildings, would measure about two miles. 
 It contains one hundred and twenty mosques, two 
 hundred and twenty public baths, and innumera 
 ble coffee-houses. The mosques are large stone 
 buildings, not lofty in proportion to their extent on 
 the ground, and have usually erected upon their 
 corners small square towers, or minarets, whence 
 the inferior priests call the people to prayers. 
 The baths are convenient buildings, lighted on 
 the top, provided with cold and warm water, 
 which you mingle at your pleasure, in small mar 
 ble cisterns, by the assistance of brass cocks. Ev 
 ery bather pays two rials at his entrance, for which 
 he is accommodated with a dressing-room contig 
 uous to the bathing cistern, towels, flesh-brushes, 
 and other conveniences, a glass of sherbet, and an 
 assistant if he chooses. The coffee-houses or 
 rooms are generally piazzas, with an awning over 
 them, projecting, from the front of the houses in 
 to the streets. Here the inhabitants delight to 
 loll, to drink sherbet, sip coffee, and chew opium, 
 r smoak tobacco steeped in a decoction of this* 
 exhilarating drug.

 I have already sketched a description of the 
 houses,and shall only add, that the roofs are nearly 
 flat, with a small declivity to cast the rain-water into 
 spouts. Algiers is tolerably well supplied with 
 spring- water, conveyed in pipes from the back 
 country ; but the Algerines, who are immoderate 
 ly attached to bathing, prefer rain-water as best 
 adapted to that use, considering it a luxury in com 
 parison with that obtained from the springs or sea* 
 
 The inhabitants say Algiers contains twenty 
 thousand houses, one hundred and forty thousand 
 believers, twenty-two thousand Jews, and six 
 thousand Christian slaves. I suspect that Alger- 
 ine vanity has exaggerated the truth ; but I can 
 not contradict it. Immediately before the census 
 of the inhabitants of the United States, I am told 
 persons who possessed much better means of cal 
 culation mis-ratell the population of the principal 
 towns most egregiously.

 and that in the year 1623, the Algerines threw off 
 their dependence on the Sublime Porte. Since 
 that time the Turkish court have made several at 
 tempts to reduce the Algerines to their subjection ; 
 and, by siding with the numerous pretenders to 
 the regency, so common in this unstable govern 
 ment, they have at times apparently effected their 
 design : while the Algerines, by assassinating or 
 dethroning those princes whose weakness or wants 
 have induced them to submit to extraneous power, 
 have reduced their dependence on the Sublime 
 Porte to a mere name. At present the grand seign 
 ior, fearful of loosing the very shadow of author 
 ity he has over them, contents himself with re 
 ceiving a tribute almost nominal ; consisting chief- 
 Jy of a present towards defraying the expenses of 
 the annual canopy, which is sent to adorn the 
 prophet s tomb at Medina : while, on the other 
 hand, the Algerines, dreading the grand seignior s 
 interference in their popular commotions, allow 
 the Sublime Porte to confirm the election of their 
 dey, and to badge his name, by affixing and ter 
 minating it with those of the principal officers of 
 the Turkish government. Hence the present dey, 
 whose real name is Hassan, is styled Vizier, which 
 is also the appellation of the grand seignior s first 
 minister. As bashaw, which terminates the dey s 
 name, is the Turkish title of their viceroys and 
 principal commanders, he makes war or peace, 
 negotiates treaties, coins money, and performs ev

 by the election of a furious soldiery, and wades 
 to the regency through the blood of his predeces 
 sor, yet he is no sooner invested with the insig 
 nia of office, than an implicit reverence is paid to 
 his commands, even by his ferocious electors ; and 
 though he often summons his divan, or council of 
 great officers, yet they are merely advisory. He 
 conducts foreign affairs at his own good pleasure ; 
 and as to internal he knows no restraint, except 
 from certain local customs, opinions, and tenets, 
 which he himself venerates in common with his 
 meanest subjects. Justice is administered in his 
 name. He even determines controversies in his 
 own person, besides being supposed virtually 
 present in the persons of his cadis or judges. If 
 he inclines to interfere in the determination of a 
 suit, upon his approach the authority of the cadis 
 ceases, and is merged in that of the dey. Some 
 customs have been intimated, which restrain the 
 dey s despotism. These relate principally to re 
 ligion, property, and females. He will not con 
 demn a priest to death ; and, although upon the 
 decease of a subject his landed property immedi 
 ately escheats to the reigning dey, yet he never 
 seizes it in the life of the possessor; and when a 
 man is executed for the highest crime, the females 
 of his family are treated with respect : nay, even 
 in an insurrection of the soldiery, when they mur 
 dered their dey, neither they nor his successor vi 
 olated the female apartments of the slain. A mere

 Revenue. 
 
 THE dey s revenue is stated by writers at seven 
 hundred thousand dollars per annum. If the lim 
 its of this work would permit, I think I could prove 
 it under-rated from a view of his expenditures. 
 It arises from a slight tax upon his subjects, a tri 
 bute from some Moors and tribes of Arabs in the in 
 terior country, a capitation tax upon the Jews, 
 prizes taken at sea, presents from foreign powers 
 as the price of peace, annual subsidies from those 
 nations with whom he is in alliance, and custom 
 ary presents made by his courtiers on his birth 
 day. To these may be added sums squeezed from 
 his bashaws in the government of the interior pro 
 vinces, and from the Jews as the price of his 
 protection. With these supplies he has to sup 
 port the magnificence of his court, defray the ex- 
 ^ensc of foreign embassies, pay his army, supply

 his navy, and repair his fortifications ; and by fre 
 quent gratuities, if he is not very successful and 
 popular, support his interest among those who have 
 the power to dethrone him. His proportion of 
 the prizes captured at sea, and the conciliatory 
 presents made by the commercial powers, are the 
 principal sources of his revenue. It is obviously 
 the policy of the dcy, by frequently infringing hk 
 treaties, to augment his finances by new capture?, 
 or fresh premiums for his friendship. A pacific 
 dey is sure not to reign long ; for, besides the dis 
 gust of the formidable body of sailors who are 
 emulous of employ, when the reigning dey has 
 once gone through the routine of seizing the ves 
 sels, receiving the presents, and concluding trea 
 ties with the usual foreign powers, he finds that 
 the annual payments secured by treaties are insuf 
 ficient for the maintenance of his necessary ^ex 
 penditures, and is therefore constrained frequently 
 to declare war as a principle of self-preservation. 
 I have been told the present dey condescended to 
 oxplak these principles to an American agent it? 
 Algiers, and grounded his capturing the American 
 shipping upon this necessity. I must, said the 
 dey, be at war with some nation, and yours must 
 have its turn. When the dey, from a pacific dis 
 position, or dread of foreign power, is at peace 
 with the world, the disgusted sailor and avaricious 
 soldier join to dethrone Mm having established 
 it as a maxim that all treaties expire with the 
 reigning dey, and must be renewed with his suc 
 cessor. This is undoubtedly the true source whence 
 spring those frequent and dreadful Convulsions In

 I doubt whether I can judge candidly of their

 and eat it with their fingers; though the bettet

 sociating in the coffee-houses in the city, and in the 
 country under groves, where they smoke and chat, 
 and drink cooling, not inebriating, liquors. Their 
 more active amusements are riding and throwing the 
 dart, at both which they are very expert. They 
 sometimes play at chess and draughts, but never 
 at games of chance or for money, those being ex

 That extreme caution which separates the seres

 Algiers the young people never collect to dance, 
 converse, or amuse themselves with the innocent 
 gaieties of their age. Here are no theatres, balls,

 religion the sexes never assemble together. An

 nor is the young Algerine permitted, by a thou 
 sand tender assiduities, to win the affections of 
 the future partner of his life. His choice can be 
 only directed by the rank or respectability of the 
 father of his intended bride. He never sees her 
 face until after the nuptial ceremony is performed, 
 and even some days after she has been brought 
 home to his own house. The old people fre 
 quently make the match, or, if it originates with 
 the youth, he confides his wishes to his father or 
 some respectable relation, who communicates the 
 proposal to the lady s father. If he receives it 
 favourably, the young couple are allowed to ex 
 change some unmeaning messages, by an old nurse 
 of the family. The bride s father or her next 
 male kin with the bridegroom go before the cadi, 
 and sign a contract of marriage, which is attested 
 by the relatives on each side. The bridegroom 
 *!ien pays a stipulated sum to the bride s father ;

 the nuptial ceremony is performed in private, and 
 the bridegroom retires. After some days the 
 bride is richly arrayed, accompanied by females, 
 and conveyed in a covered coach or waggon, gau 
 dy with flowers, to her husband s house. Here 
 she is immediately immured in the women s ap 
 artments, while the bridegroom and his friends 
 share a convivial feast. After some ceremonies, 
 the nature of which I could not discover, the bride 
 groom enters the women s apartment, and for 
 the first time discovers whether his wife has a 
 nose or eyes. Among the higher ranks, it is said&amp;gt; 
 the bride, after the expiration of a month, goes 
 to the public bath for women, is there received 
 -with great parade, and loaded with presents by 
 Jaer female relations, assembled on the occasion. 
 The bridegroom also receives presents from hic- 
 friends. 
 
 Within a limited time the husband may break 
 the contract, provided he will add another item 
 to that already given, return his bride with all 
 her paraphernalia, and, putting the holy Alcoran 
 to his breast, assert that he never benefited him 
 self of the rights of a husband. 
 
 Notwithstanding the apparent restraint the wo 
 men are under, they are said to be attached to 
 their husbands, and enjoy greater liberty than is 
 generally conceived. I certainly saw many wo 
 men in the streets so muffled up, and their out 
 ward garments so much alike, that their nearest 
 .relatives could not distinguish one from another, 
 The vulgar slaves conjecture that the women take 
 great liberties in this general disguise.

 Their funerals are decent, but not ostentatious^,

 preceded by the priests chanting passages from 
 the Alcoran in a dolorous tone. Wherever the

 The relatives follow with the folds of their tur 
 bans loosened. The bodies of the rich are de

 This fortunate impostor, like all other great 
 characters in the drama of life, has been indig 
 nantly vilified by his opponents, and as ardently 
 praised by his adherents. 1 shall endeavour to 
 steer the middle course of impartiality ; neither

 Mahomet was born in the 568ih year of the 
 Christian sera. He was descended from the Core- 
 is, one of tjie noblest of the Arabian tribes. His 
 father Abdalla was a man of moderate fortune, 
 and bestowed upon his son such an education as a 
 parent in confined, if not in impoverished, circum 
 stances could confer. The Turks say he could 
 not write, because they pride themselves in de 
 crying letters ,japd because the pious among them 
 suppose his ignorance of letters a sufficient evi 
 dence of the dr ine original of the book he pub 
 lished, as received from and written by the finger 
 of Deity. 
 
 But when the Arabian authors record that he 
 was employed as a factor by his uncle Abutileb, 
 there can little doubt remain but that he was pos 
 sessed of all the literary acquirements necessary 
 to accomplish him for his business. He has been 
 stigmatized as a mere camel-driver. He had the 
 direction of camels it is true. The merchandize 
 of Arabia was transported to different regions by 
 caravans of those useful animals, of a troop of 
 which he was conductor ; but there was as much 
 difference between his station and employment, 
 and that of a common camel-driver, as between

 the supercargo of an India ship in our days, and 
 the seaman before the mast. In his capacity of 
 factor, he travelled into Syria, Palestine, and 
 Egypt ; and acquired the most useful knowledge 
 in each country. He is represented as a man of 
 a beautiful person and commanding presence. 
 By his engaging manners and remarkable atten 
 tion to business, he became the factor of a rich 
 Arabian merchant, after whose death he married 
 his widow, the beautiful Cadijah, and came into 
 the lawful possession of immense wealth, which 
 awakened in him the most unbounded ambition. 
 By the venerable custom of his nation, his polit 
 ical career was confined to his own tribe ; and 
 the patriarchal being the prominent feature of the 
 Arabian government, he could not hope to sur 
 mount the claims of elder families, even in his 
 own tribe, the genealogies of which were accu 
 rately preserved. To be the founder and proph 
 et of a new religion would secure a glorious pre 
 eminence, highly gratifying to his ambition, and 
 not thwarting the pretensions of the tribes. 
 
 Mankind are apt to impute the most profound 
 abilities to founders of religious systems, and oth 
 er successful adventurers, when perhaps they owe 
 their success more to a fortunate coincidence of 
 circumstances, and their only merit is the sagaci 
 ty to avail themselves of that tide in the affairs 
 of men which leads to wealth and honour. Per 
 haps there never was a conjuncture more favour 
 able for the introduction of a new religion than 
 tfoat of which Mahomet availed himself. He was

 been persecuted by the Athenasians into an abhor 
 rence of almost every other Christian tenet : by 
 Jews, who had fled from the vindictive emperor 
 Adrian, and who too wilfully blind to see the ac 
 complishment of their prophecies in the person of 
 our Saviour, in the midst of exile were ready to 
 contemn those prophecies which had so long de 
 luded them with a Messiah who never came : and 
 by Pagans, whose belief in a plurality of gods 
 made them the ready proselytes of any novel sys 
 tem ; and the more wise of whom were disgusted 
 with the gross absurdities of their own mythology, 
 The system of Mahomet is said to have been 
 calculated to attach all these. To gratify the 
 Arian and the Jew, he maintained the unity of 
 God ; and, to please the Pagans, he adopted many 
 of their exterpral rites, as fastings, washings, &c. 
 Certain it is, he spoke of Moses and the patriarchs 
 as messengers from heaven, and that he declared 
 Jesus Christ to be the true Messias, and the exem

 commenced writing the Alcoran. His first prose 
 lytes were of his own family, the next of his near 
 relatives. But the tribe of Corei were so famil 
 iar with the person and life of Mahomet that they 
 despised his pretensions ; and fearful lest what 
 they styled his mad enthusiasm should bring a 
 stigma upon their tribe, they first attempted to 
 reason him out of his supposed delusion ; and this 
 failing they sought to destroy him. But a special 
 messenger of heaven, who, Mahomet says, meas 
 ured ten million furlongs at every step, informed 
 him of their design, and he fled to Medina, the 
 inhabitants of which city, being already prepos 
 sessed in favour of his doctrine, received him with 
 great respect.* 
 
 He soon inspired them with the most implicit

 uounced all those who died fighting in his cause to 
 be entitled to the glory of martyrs in the heaven

 the ancient feuds among the neighbouring tribes, 
 caused his disciples in Medina to wage war upon 
 their neighbours, whom they invariably conquer 
 ed when he headed their troops. The tribe of 
 Corei, flattered by the honours paid their kinsman, 
 and confounded by the repeated reports of his 
 victories, were soon proselyted, and became after 
 wards the most enthusiastic supporters of his pow 
 er. In 627 he was crowned sovereign at Medina, 
 like the divine Melchisedec uniting in his person 
 the high titles of prophet and king. He subdued 
 the greater part of Arabia, and obtained a respect 
 able footing in Syria. He died at Medina in the 
 year 633, and in the sixty-fourth year of his age. 
 European writers, who have destroyed almost as

 have with the guillotine, have attributed his death 
 to a dose administered by a monk. But when we

 need not recur to any but natural means tor tb.

 UPON the decease of the prophet his followers 
 were almost confounded. They could scarcely 
 credit their senses. They fancied him only in a 
 swoon, and waited in respectful silence until he 
 should again rise to lead them to conquest and 
 glory. His more confidential friends gathered 
 around the corpse ; and, being impressed with 
 the policy of immediately announcing his succes 
 sor, they held a fierce debate upon the subject. 
 In the Alcoran they found no direction for the 
 election, nor any successor to the caliphate point 
 ed out. They .agreed to send for his wives and 
 confidential domestics. The youngest of his 
 wives produced some writings, containing the pre 
 cious sayings of the prophet, which, she said she 
 had collected ^felier own edification. To these 
 were aftenvai^ls added stfeh observations of the 
 prophet as life H*ore intimate associates could re

 wife, the prophet had directed his great officers to 
 ^lect his successor from among them, and assured 
 them that a portion of his own power would rest 
 upon him. Abubeker, a friend and relative, and 
 successful leader of the forces of the prophet, by 
 the persuasions of those around, immediately en 
 tered the public mosque ; and, standing on the 
 steps of the desk from which the prophet used to 
 deliver his oracles, he informed the multitude that 
 God had indeed called the prophet to paradise, 
 and that his kingly authority and apostolic powers 
 res-ted upon him. To him succeeded Omar and 
 Osman : while the troops in Syria, conceiving 
 that Ali their leader was better entitled to suc 
 ceed than either, elevated him also to the caliph 
 ate, though he refused the dignity until he was 
 called by the voice of the people to succeed Os 
 man. Hence sprang that great schism which has 
 divided the Mussulman world ; but though divi 
 ded as to the successor of the prophet, both par 
 ties were actuated by his principles and adhered 
 jo his creed. Omar and his successors turned 
 iheir arms towards Europe ; and, under the name 
 of Saracens or Moors, possessed themselves of the 
 greater part of Spain and the Mediterranean isles ; 
 while the friends of Ali, establishing themselve* 
 as sovereigns, made equal ravages upon Persia,/&quot; 
 and even to the great peninsula of India.

 The Faith of the Jllgerines. 
 
 THE Algerine doctors assert that the language of 
 the Alcoran is so ineffably pure, it can never be 
 rendered into any other tongue. To this they can 
 didly impute the miserable vitiated translations of 
 the Christians, whom they charge with having 
 garbled the sacred book, and degraded its sublime 
 allegories and metaphors into absurd tales. This 
 is certain, the portions which 1 have heard chan 
 ted at funerals and quoted in conversation ever ex 
 hibited the pur^ morality and the sublimest con 
 ceptions of the Deity. The fundamental doctrine 
 of the Alcoran is the unity of God. The evil spi 
 rit, says the Koran, is subtly deluding men into 
 the belief that there are more go^s than one, that in 
 the confusion of deities he may obtain a share of de 
 votion ; while the Supreme Being, pitying the de 
 lusions of man, has sent Abraham, Moses, Soliman,

 breathed forth the Messias of the Christian in a 
 sigh of divine pity, and lastly sent Mahomet, the 
 seal of the prophets, to reclaim men to this essen 
 tial truth. The next fundamental points in the 
 Mussulman creed are a belief in the eternal de 
 crees of God, in a resurrection and final judgment 
 to bliss or misery. Some hold with Chiristians 
 that the future punishment will be infinite, while 
 others suppose that, when the souls of the wicked 
 are purified by fire, they will be received into the 
 favour of God. They adhere to many other points 
 of practical duty : such as daily prayers, frequent 
 ablutions, acts of charity, and severe fastings ; that 
 of Rhammadin is the principal, which is similar 
 to the catholic Lent in abstinence, for the penitent 
 abstains only from a particular kind of food, while 
 he gluts himself with others perhaps more luscious. 
 The Alcoran tilso forbids games of chance and 
 the use of strong liquors ; inculcates a tenderness 
 for idiots and a respect for age. The Book of the 
 Companions of the Apostle enjoins a pilgrimage 
 to his tomb, to be made by the true believers once 
 at least in their lives ; but, though they view the 
 authority which enjoined this tedious journey di 
 vine, yet they have contrived to evade its rigour 
 by allowing the believer to perform it by proxy or 
 attorney. 
 
 Upon the whole, there do not appear to be any 
 articles in their faith which incite them to immo 
 rality, or can countenance the cruelties they com- 
 mit. Neither their Alcoran nor their priests excite 
 them to plunder, enslave, or torment. The for* 
 jner expressly recommends charity, justice, and

 mercy, towards their fellow men. I would npl 
 bring the sacred volume of our faith in any com 
 parative view with the Alcoran of Mahomet ; but 
 1 cannot help noticing it as extraordinary, that the 
 Mahometan should abominate the Christian on ac 
 count of his faith, and the Christian detest the 
 Mussulman for his creed ; when the Koran of the 
 former acknowledges the divinity of the Christian 
 Messias, and the Bible of the latter commands us 
 to love our enemies. If either would follow tfce 
 obvious dictates of his own scripture, he would 
 cfease to hate, abominate, and destroy the other.

 success ; but this is not to be expected ; as it nev 
 er can be the interest of the Sublime Porte to 
 suppress them, and the common faith of the Mus 
 sulman has more influence in uniting its professors 
 than the creed of the Christian, to the disgrace of 
 the latter : and, as the grand seignior s dominion 
 over the Algerines is little more than nominal, he is 
 anxious to conciliate their favour by affording them 
 his protection ; considering prudently, that, though 
 intractable, they are still a branch of the Mussul 
 man stock. Provoked by their insults he has some 
 times withdrawn his protection, as was the case 
 when he, by treaty with the Venetians, permit 
 ted their fleet to enter the Ottoman ports, for the 
 express purpose of destroy ing the Algerine galleys ; 
 but it is obvious the Sublime Porte meant merely 
 to chastise not to ruin them. 
 
 In the grand,seignior s wars with the Europeans, 
 the piratical states have rendered signal services, 
 and he himself not unfrequently receives valua 
 ble douceurs for exerting his supposed influence 
 over them in favour of oneor another of the contend 
 ing powers of Europe. In the siege of Gibraltar 
 by the Spaniards, during the late American war, 
 that garrison received frequent supplies of provi 
 sions from the Barbary shore ; but, by the applica 
 tion of Lewis XVI. to the Sublime Porte, the grand 
 seignior influenced the Barbary states to prohibit 
 those supplies ; and the English consul was dis 
 missed from one of them with the most pointed 
 marks of contempt. While the grand seignior 
 reaps such solid advantages from them, it is absurd 
 o think of his co-operation against them :

 can a union with the European powers be more 
 fully anticipated. Jealousy as often actuates migh- 
 ~ty nations as weak individuals. Whoever turns 
 over the pages of history attentively will there per 
 ceive that sordid passion is the impulse of action to 
 the greatest states. Commercial states are also ac 
 tuated by avarice a passion still more baneful in 
 , ; ts effects. These excite war, and are the grand 
 plenipotentiaries in the adjustment of the articles of 
 peace. Hence it is that, while every European 
 power is solicitous to enrich and aggrandise itself, 
 it can never join in any common project, the result 
 of which, it is fearful, may benefit its neighbour ; 
 and is content to suffer injury rather than its rival 
 should share in a common good. Hence also it is 
 that Christian states, instead of uniting to vindicate 
 their insulted faith, join together the cross and cres 
 cent in unholy alliance, and form degrading trea 
 ties with piratical powers ; and, as the summit of 
 political folly, present to those very powers, for 
 the purchase of their friendship, weapons to annoy 
 themselves in the first war that their avatice or 
 caprice shall wage. Nay, should ever a confeder 
 acy of the European powers be formed against 
 the Algerines, experience affords us but slender 
 hopes of its success ; for 1 will venture to assert 
 that, from the confederacy of Ahab and Jehosha- 
 phat, when they went up to battle at Ramoth 
 Gilead, to the treaty of Pilnitz, there never was 
 yet a combination of princes or nations, who, by 
 an actual union of thejr forces, attained the object 
 of their coalition. If the political finger be poin

 ception, I likewise will point to the distcacting 
 period when that conqueror was superseded by the 
 duke of Onnorid ; and the treaty of Utrecht will 
 confirm the opinion 1 have advanced. 
 
 The detail of the history of the Algerines evin 
 ces that the arms of individual states can be attend 
 ed with no decisive success. Indeed the expense 
 of an efficacious armament would defray the price 
 of the dey s friendship for years ; and the powers 
 of Europe submit to his insults and injuries from a 
 principle of economy. An absolute conquest of 
 the Algerine territory cannot be erected but by 
 invasion from the interior, through the co-operation 
 of the grand seignior or the assistance of the other 
 Barbary states. The former, 1 have shown, can 
 not be expected ; and the latter, for obvious rea 
 sons, is as little to be thought of. A permanent 
 conquest of the city and port of Algiers cannot 
 be effected without the subjection of the interior 
 country. , Temporary though spirited attacks up 
 on that city and port have never answered any sal 
 utary purpose. They may be compared to the 
 destruction of our sea-ports in our revolutionary 
 war. The port attacked bore so small a propor 
 tion to the whole, that its destruction rather served 
 to irritate than to weaken or subjugate. It should 
 be considered likewise that the houses of the Alge 
 rines are built of slight and cheap meterials ; that 
 upon the approach of an enemy the rich effects of 
 the inhabitants are easily removed in-land, while 
 nothing remains but heavy fortifications to batter, 
 and buildings which can be readilv restored to

 how sensible the Algerines themselves are of these 
 advantages. When the French vice-admiral, the 
 marquis de Quesne, made his first attack on Algiers, 
 he sent an officer with a flag on shore, who magni 
 fied the force of his commander, and threatened 
 to lay the city in ashes if the demands of the mar 
 quis were not immediately complied with. The 
 dey, who had, upon the first approach of the ene 
 my, removed the aged, the females, and his rich 
 est effects, coolly inquired of the officer how much 
 the levelling his city to ashes would cost. The of 
 ficer, thinking to increase the dey s admiration 
 of the power of the grand monarque, answered 
 two millions of livres. Tell your commander, 
 said the dey, if he will send me half the money I 
 will burn the city to ashes myself.

 be the detection and punishment of common cheats, 
 and to suppress broils among the vulgar; and, as

 there are many others who never meddle with suits

 confess that, when I left the Unitetlj States, the

 view the judicial proceedings of our country with 
 a jaundiced x eye ; and, when I was made ac

 justice, I yearned to see a cause determined in a 
 court where instant decision relieved the anxiety 
 and saved the purses of the parties, and where 
 no long-winded attorney was suffered to perplex 
 the judge ^yith subtle argument or musty precedent. 
 1 was soon delighted with an excellent display of 
 summary justice. Observing a collection of peo

 religion, had sent a proxy to the prophet s tomb 
 at Medina, and maintained an idiot ; that he 
 never cheated any man before, but was justified 
 in what he had done, for, ten years before, the 
 plaintiff had cheated him worse in the sale of a. 
 dromedary, which proved broken-winded. He 
 proved this by several witnesses, and the plaintiff 
 could not deny it. The judge immediately or 
 dered the mule and the money paid for it to be^ 
 produced. He then directed his attendants to 
 seize the defendant, and give him fifty blows on 
 the soles of his feet for this fraud. The plaintiff 
 at every stroke applauded the cadi s justice to the 
 skies ; but no sooner was the punishment inflicted^ 
 than, by a nqd from the judge, the exulting plain 
 tiff was seized, and received the same number 
 of blows with the batten for the old affair of the 
 broken- winded- dromedary. The parties were 
 then dismissed without costs, and the judge or 
 dered an officer to take the mule, sell it at pub 
 lic outcry, and distribute the product, with the 
 money deposited, in alms to the poor. The of 
 ficer proceeded a few steps with the* mule, and I 
 thought the court had risen, when the/cadi, sup 
 posing one of the witnesses had prevaricated in 
 his testimony, called back the officer who had 
 charge of the mule, ordered the witness to receive 
 twenty-five blows of the batten, and be mounted 
 on the back of the mule with his face towards the 
 fail, and be thus carried through the city, direct*

 that I think I have not materially varied from the 
 sentiment. I present it to the candid reader, as 
 a curious specimen of their pulpit eloquence ; and 
 as perhaps conveying a more satisfactory idea of 
 their creed than I have already attempted in the 
 account I have given of their religion. The attri 
 butes of Deity were the subject of the priest s 
 discourse ; and, after some exordium, he elevated 
 his voice and exclaimed : 
 
 GOD ALONE is IMMORTAL ! Ibraham and Soli- 
 man have slept with their fathers ; Cadijah the 
 first-born of faith, Ayesha the beloved, Omar the 
 meek, Ornri the benevolent, the companions of 
 the apostle and the Sent of God himself, all died ;

 Infinities are to him as the numerals of arithmetic 
 to the sons of Adam : the earth shall vanish before 
 the decrees of his eternal destiny ; but he liveth 
 and reigneth for ever 
 
 GOD ALONE is OMNISCIENT ! Michael, whose

 dark night is unto him as the rays of the morning ; 
 for he noticeth the creeping of the small pismire

 GOD ALONE is OMNIPRESENT ! He toucheth the 
 immensity of space as a point. He moveth in 
 the depths of ocean, and mount Atlas is hidden 
 by the sole of his foot. He breatheth fragrant 
 odours to cheer the blessed in paradise, and en- 
 liveneth the pallid flame in the profoundest hell.

 derings of Hermon are the whisperings of his 
 voice ; the rustling of his attire causeth lightning 
 and an earthquake ; and with the shadow of his 
 garment he blotteth out the sun. 
 
 GOD ALONE is MERCIFUL i When he forged 
 his immutable decrees on the anvil of eternal wis 
 dom, he tempered the miseries of the race of Is- 
 mael in the fountains of pity. When he laid the 
 foundations of the world, he cast a look of benev 
 olence into the abysses of futurity ; and the ad 
 amantine pillars of eternal justice were softened 
 by the beamings of his eyes. He dropped a tear 
 upon the embryo miseries of unborn man ; and 
 that tear, falling through the immeasurable lapses 
 of time, shall quench the glowing flames of the 
 bottomless pit. He sent his prophet into the 
 world to enlighten the darkness of the tribes ; and 
 hath prepared the pavilions of the hour! for the re 
 pose of the true believers. 
 
 GOD ALONE is JUST ! He chains the latent 
 cause to the distant event ; and binds them both 
 immutably fast to the fitness of things. He de 
 creed the unbeliever to wander amidst the whirl 
 winds of error ; and suited his soul to future tor 
 ment. He promulgated the ineffable creed ; and 
 the germs of countless souls of believers, which 
 existed in the contemplation of Deity, expanded 
 at the sound. His justice refresheth the faithful, 
 while the damned spirits confess it in despair.

 without giving umbrage. I sometimes strayed in 
 to that quarter of the city principally inhabiled by 
 Jews. This cunning race, since Iheir dispersion 
 by Vespasian and Titus, have contrived to com 
 pensate themselves for the loss of Palestine &quot; by 
 engrossing the wealth, and often the luxuries, of ev 
 ery other land ; and, wearied with the expecta 
 tion of that heavenly king,&quot; who shall re-possess 
 them of the holy city, and put their enemies be 
 neath their feet, now solace themselves with a 
 Messiah whose glory is enshrined in their coffers. 
 Rigidly attached to their own customs, intermar 
 rying among themselves, content to be apparently 
 wretched and despised, that they may wallow in 
 secret wealth ; and secluded in most countries 
 from holding landed property,and in almostall from 
 filling offices of power and profit, they are general 
 ly received as meet instruments to do the mean 
 drudgery of despotic courts. The wealth which 
 would render a subject too powerful, the despot 
 can trust with an unambitious Jew ; and confide 
 secrets which involve his own safety to a miserable 
 Israelite, whom he can annihilate with a nod. The 
 Jews transacl almost all the dey s private business-, 
 besides that of the negotiations of merchants. Nay, 
 if an envoy from a foreign power comes to treat 
 with the dey, he may have the parade of a pub 
 lic audience ; but if he wishes to accomplish his 
 embassy, he must employ a Jew ; and it is said 
 the dey himself shares with the Jew the very sums 
 paid him for his influence with this politic despot

 from foreign powers. They are therefore allowed 
 to assemble in their synagogues ; and have fre 
 quently an influence at the court of the dey, with 
 his great officers, and even before the civil judge, 
 not to be accounted for from the morality of their 
 conduct. Popular prejudice is generally against 
 them ; and the dey often avails himself of it by 
 heavy amercements for his protection. In the 
 year 1690, he threatened to extripate the whole 
 race in his dominions, and was finally appeased 
 by a large contribution they raised and offered as 
 an expiation of a supposed offence. It was com 
 monly reported, that the Jews in Algiers at that 
 time had procured a Christian child, which they 
 privately purified with much ceremony, fattened, 
 and prepared for a sacrifice at their feasts of the 
 passover, as a, substitute for the paschal lamb. 
 This horrid tale, which should have been despised 
 for its absurdity and inhumanity, the dey affected 
 to credit. He appointed several Mahometan 
 priests to search the habitations of the Jews imme-&amp;gt; 
 diately before the feast of the passover, who, dis 
 covering some bitter herbs and other customary 
 preparations for the festival, affected to have found 
 sufficient evidence against them ; and the mob of 
 Algiers, mad with rage and perhaps inflamed by 
 the usurious exactions of particular Jews, rushed 
 on furiously to pillage and destroy the wretched de 
 scendants of Jacob. Two houses were demolish

 nothing less than the destruction of so useful a

 who brought me provisions the cause of my con

 shake of the head. The next day the director of 
 the hospital appeared. To him I applied with 
 great earnestness ; but all the information he 
 would give was, that it was by the dey s order 
 I was confined ; and that he, with the physicians 
 and my friend the mollah, were using all their in 
 fluence to obtain my release. He counselled me 
 to amuse myself in preparing and compounding 
 drugs, and promised to see me again as soon as he 
 could bring any good news. About a week after 
 an officer of the court, with a city judge, entered 
 my apartment, and informed me of the cause ol

 neath the burthens of slavery, to have saved them 
 from an Algerine captivity. I could readily as 
 sure the dey s officers that 1 had not conversed with 
 rny miserable countrymen ; but, while 1 spake, the 
 idea of embracing a fellow citizen, a brother Chris 
 tian, perhaps some one who came from the same 
 state, or had been in the same town, or seen my 
 dear parents, passed in rapid succession, and I 
 was determined, betide what would, to seek them 
 the first opportunity. We were soon joined by 
 the rnollah, who repeatedly assured my examin 
 ers, that, though an infidel, 1 might be believed. 
 By his solicitation I was to be released ; but not 
 until I would bind myself by a solemn oath, ad 
 ministered after the Christian manner, that I would 
 never speak to any of the American slaves. When 
 this oath was proposed, I doubted whether to take 
 it ; but recollecting that, if I did not, I should be 
 equally debarred from seeing them, and suffer a 
 grievous confinement, which could do them no ser 
 vice, 1 consented, and bound myself never directly 
 or indirectly to attempt to visitor converse with 
 my fellow citizens in slavery. It was at the same 
 time intimated to me, that for the breach of this 
 oath I might expect to be impaled alive. Often 
 when I have drawn near the places of their con 
 finement auJ labours, I have regretted my submit 
 ting to this oath, and once was almost tempted to 
 break it, at seeing captain O Brien at some dis

 AFTER I had taken this oath the officers departed, 
 and 1 was liberated. I was now more cautious 
 in my rambles, avoided the notice of the Mus-

 to that part of the city inhabited by Jews and for

 place, in order to assassinate me by the direction of 
 my superiors, who might wish to destroy me in 
 this secret manner. But I had but little time for 
 these gloomy reflexions ; for opening another door 
 I was startled with a blaze of light let into apart 
 ments splendidly furnished. My conductor now 
 assumed an air of importance, requested me to 
 repose myself on a silken couch, and retired. A 
 young lady who was veiled, of a graceful person 
 and pleasing address, soon brought a plate of 
 sweetmeats and a bottle of excellent wine. The 
 old man soon re-appeared ; but so changed in his 
 habit and appearance, I could scarce recognize 
 him. He was now arrayed in drawers of the fin 
 est linen, an embroidered vest, and loose gown 
 of the richest Persian silk. He smiled at my sur 
 prise, shook me by the hand, and told me that he 
 was a Jew ; assuring me that he was with his 
 brethren under the protection of the dey. The 
 outward appearance of his house and the meanness 
 of his attire abroad were, he said, necessary, to a- 
 void envy and suspicion. But come, said he, I 
 know all about you ; I can confide in you. Come, 
 refresh yourself with a glass of this wine ; nei 
 ther Moses nor your Messiah forbid the use of it. 
 We ate of the collation, drank our wine liberally, 
 and then he introduced me to his son, whom 1 
 found laboring under a violent ague. I adminis 
 tered some sudorifics, and left directions for the 
 future treatment of my patient. Upon my depar 
 ture, the Jew put a sequin into my hand, and

 ing me to seat myself in the place be had fouwl 
 me in at the same hour the next day but one 
 afterwards ; and, in passing through the dark en 
 try, conjured me not to mention his domestic style 
 of living. The name of this Jew was Adonah 
 Ben Benjamin. I visited his son according to ap 
 pointment, and found him nearly restored to health 
 The father and son both expressed great gratitude &amp;gt; 
 but the former told me he would not pay me for 
 this visit in silver or gold, but with something 
 more valuable, by his advice. Come and see me 
 sometimes ; I know this people well, and may 
 render you more service than you expect. I af 
 terwards visited this Jew frequently, and from 
 him obtained much information. He told me, in 
 much confidence, that soon after I was taken, a 
 Jew and two ^.Igerines made a tour of the United 
 States, and sent home an accurate account of the 
 American commerce ; and that the dey was so 
 impressed with the idea of our wealth, that he 
 would never permit the American slaves to be 
 ransomed under a large premium, which must 
 be accompanied with the usual presents, as a 
 purchase of peace, and an annual tribute. Ex 
 pressing my anxiety to recover my freedom, he 
 advised me to write to some of the American 
 agents in Europe. I accordingly addressed a let 
 ter to William Carmichael, esq. charge des affaires 
 from the United States at the court of Madrid, 
 representing my deplorable circumstances and the 
 miserable state of my fellow prisoners, praying 
 the interference of our government, stating the 
 probable mode of access to the dey, and enclos-

 ing a letter to my parents. This my friend the 
 Jew promised to convey ; but as I never received 
 any answer from Mr. Carmichael, and my letters 
 never found the way to my friends, I conclude, 
 from the known humanity of that gentleman, my 
 letters miscarried. 
 
 Some time after I heard that the United States 
 had made application, through Mr Lamb, for the 
 redemption of their citizens, and 1 had hopes of 
 liberty ; intending, if that gentleman succeeded 
 in his negotiations, to claim my right to be ran 
 somed as an American citizen ; but his proposals 
 were scouted with contempt. I have sometimes 
 heard this gentleman censured for failing to accom 
 plish the object of his mission ; but very unjustly, 
 as I well remember that I, who was much inter 
 ested in his success, never blamed him at the time ; 
 and I know the ransom he offered the dey was ri 
 diculed in the common coffee-houses as extremely 
 pitiful. The few Algerines I conversed with af 
 fected to represent it as insulting. It was report 
 ed that he was empowered to offer only two hun 
 dred dollars per head for each prisoner indiscrim 
 inately, when the common price was four thou 
 sand dollars per head for a captain of a vessel, and 
 one thousand four hundred for a common fore 
 mast sailor. When this unsuccessful attempt fail 
 ed, the prisoners were treated with greater sever- 
 iry ; doubtless with a design to affright the Amer 
 icans into terms more advantageous to the dey. 
 
 Finding my hopes of release from the applica 
 tions of my country to fade, I consulted the friend 
 ly /ew, who advised me to endeavour to pay my

 own ransom, which he said might be effected with 
 my savings from my practice by the mediation of 
 a rich Jew, his relation. 1 accordingly put all 
 my savings into Adonah Ben Benjamin s hands, 
 which amounted to two hundred and eighty doU 
 lars, and resolved to add to it all I could procure, 
 To this intent 1 hoarc od up all 1 could obtain { 
 denying myself the slender refreshments of bath 
 ing, and cooling liquors, to which I had been for 
 some time accustomed. The benevolent Hebrew 
 having promised that, when I had attained the sum 
 requisite, within two or three hundred dollars, he 
 would himself advance the remainder, no miser 
 was ever more engaged than I was to increase my 
 store. After a tedious interval my prospects 
 brightened surprisingly. Some fortunate opera 
 tions which \ performed obtained me valuable 
 presents ; one to the amount of fifty dollars. My 
 stock in the Jew s hands had increased to nine 
 hundred dollars ; and to add to my good fortune 
 the Jew told me in great confidence, that, from 
 the pleasing account of the United States which 
 I had given him for I always spake of the pri 
 vileges of my native land with fervour he was 
 determined to remove with his family thither. 
 He said he would make up the deficiency in my 
 ransom, and send me home by the first European 
 vessel, with letters to a Mr. Lopez, a Jew, who, 
 he said, lived in Rhode Island or Massachusetts, 
 tD whom he had a recommendation from a relation 
 who had been in America. To Mr. Lopez he in 
 tended to consign his property. He accordingly 
 procured his friend, whose mama I did not ther*

 learn, to agree about my ransom. He concluded 
 the contract at two thousand dollars. My friends 
 in the hospital expressed sorrow at parting with 
 ine ; and making me some pecuniary presents, I 
 immediately added them to my stock in the hands 
 of the Jew. In order to lessen the price of my 
 ransom, the contractor had old my master that he 
 was to advance the money, and take my word 
 N&amp;gt; remit it upon my return to my friends. This 
 story I confirmed. I went to the Jew s house, 
 who honestly produced all my savings ; we count* 
 fid them together, and he added the remainder, 
 tying the mooey up in two large bags. We spent 
 \ happy hour over a bottL of his best wine ; I in 
 anticipating the pleasure my parents and friends 
 would receive in recovering their son who was 
 lost, and the Jew in framing plans of commerce in 
 the United States, and in the enjoyment of his rich 
 es in a country where no despot should force from 
 him his honest gains ; and what added to my en 
 joyment was the information that a vessel was to 
 sail for Gibraltar in two days, in which he assu

 capered and danced as merrily as my youthful 
 acquaintance at a husking. Sometimes I would 
 be lost in thought, and then burst suddenly into 
 loud laughter. The next day, towards evening.

 see if he had engaged my passage, and to gratify 
 myself with conversing upon my native land. Be-

 key of the front door. I opened it hastily, and, 
 passing the entry, knocked for admittance at the 
 inner door, which was soon opened ; but, instead 
 of the accustomed splendor, all was gloomy the 
 windows darkened, and the family in tears : poor 
 Adonah Ben Benjamin had that morning been struck 
 with an apoplexy, and slept with his fathers. I 
 soon retired, as sincere a mourner as the nearest 
 kindred. I had indeed more reason to mourn than 
 I conceived; for, upon applying to his son for his 
 assistance in perfecting my freedom, which his 
 good father had so happily begun, he professed the 
 utmost ignorance of the whole transaction ; decla 
 red that he did not know the name of the agent 
 his father had employed, and gave no credit to 
 my account of the monies I had lodged with his 
 father. I described the bags. He coolly an 
 swered, that the God of his father Abraham had 
 blessed his father Adonah with many such bags. 
 I left him, distracted with my disappointment. 
 Sometimes I determined to relate the whole sto 
 ry to the director of the hospital, and apply for 
 legal redress to a cadi; but the specimen I had 
 of an Algerine law-suit deterred me. I had been 
 so inadvertent as to countenance the story that a 
 Jew was to advance the whole sum for me. If 
 I had been a Mussulman I might have attested to 
 my story ; but a slave is never admitted as an 
 evidence in Algiers, the West Indies, or the 
 Southern States. The disappointment of my 
 hopes were soon known in the hospital, though 
 the hand of Adonah Ben Benjamin had in the con- 
 rao-t remained a secret. The artful JRW

 had contracted for my ransom, fearing he should 
 have to advance the money himself, spread a re 
 port that I was immensely rich in my own country. 
 This corning to the ears of my master he raised 
 my ransom to six thousand dollars, which the wily 
 Israelite declining to pay, the contract was dis 
 solved. From my master I learned his name, and 
 waited upon him, hoping to obtain some evidence 
 of Adonah s having received my money, at least 
 so far as to induce his son to restore it. But the 
 Jew positively declared that Adonah never told 
 him other than that he Was to advance the cash 
 himself. Thus, from the brightest hopes of free 
 dom, 1 was reduced to despair, my money lost, 
 and my ransom raised. I bless a merciful God 
 that I was preserved from the desperate folly of 
 suicide. I never attempted my life ; but when I 
 lay down I often hoped that I might never awake 
 again in this world of misery. I grew dejected, 
 and my flesh wasted. The physicians recom 
 mended a journey into the country, which my 
 master approved ; for, since the report of my 
 wealth in my native land, he viewed my life as 
 valuable to him, as he doubted not but my friends 
 would one day ransom me at an exhorbitant pre 
 mium.

 ARGUMENT. 
 
 The Author, by Permissson of his Master, travels 
 to Medina , the Burial-Place of the Prophet 
 Mahomet. 
 
 THE director soon after proposed that I should at 
 tend some merchants as a surgeon in a voyage and 
 journey to Medina, which is the burial, as Mecca 
 is the birth place of the prophet Mahomet ; assur 
 ing me that I should be treated with respect, and 
 indeed find some agreeable companions -on the 
 tour, as several of the merchants were infidels 
 like myself, and that any monies I might ac 
 quire by itinerant practice should be my own. 
 1 accepted this proposal with pleasure, and was 
 soon leased to two Mussulman merchants, who 
 gave a kind of bond for my safe return to my 
 master. I had cash advanced me to purchase 
 medicines and a case of surgeon s instruments,, 
 which I was directed to stow in a large leather 
 wallet. I took a kind leave of my patrons in the 
 hospital, who bestowed many little presents of 
 sweetmeats, dates, and oranges. I waited upon 
 the good mollah, who presented me with fifty dol 
 lars. I have charity to believe that this man, 
 Chough an apostate, was sincere in his faith in the

 Mahometan creed. He pressed ray hand at part 
 ing, gave me many salutary cautions as to my 
 conduct during the voyage ; and said, while the 
 tears started in his eyes, my friend, you have suf 
 fered much misfortune and misery in a short life ; 
 let me conjure you not to add the torments of the 
 future to the miseries of the present world. But, 
 added he, pausing, who shall alter the decrees of 
 God ? I flatter myself that the scales of natal pre 
 judice will yet fall from your eyes, and that jour 
 name has heen numbered among the faithful from 
 all eternity. 
 
 Our company consisted of two Algerine mei&amp;gt; 
 chants or factors, twenty pilgrims, nine Jews, 
 among whom was the son of my deceased friend 
 Adonah, and two Greek traders from Chios, who 
 carried with them several bales of silks and a 
 quantity of mastic, to vend at Scandaroon, Grand 
 Cairo, and Medina. We took passage in a xebec ; 
 and, coasting the African shore, soon passed the 
 ruins of ancient Carthage, the Bay of Tunis ; 
 and, weathering Cape Bona and steering south 
 easterly, one morning hove in sight of the island 
 of Malta, inhabited by the knights of that name, 
 who are sworn enemies of the Mahometan faith. 
 I could perceive that the sight of this island gave 
 a sensible alarm to the crew and passengers : but 
 the captain, or rather the skipper, who was a 
 blustering rough renegado, affected great courage, 
 and swore that if he had but one cannon on board 
 he would run down and give a broadside to the 
 infidel dogs. Plis bravery was soon put to the 
 test ; for, as the sun arose, we could discern plain-

 \y an armed vessel bearing down upon us. She 
 overhauled us fast, and our skipper conjectuied 
 she bore the Maltese colours. All hands were 
 now summoned to get out some light sails, and 
 several oars were put out, at which the brave skip 
 per tugged as lustily as the meanest of us. When 
 the wind lulled, and we gained of the vessel, he 
 would run on the quarters of the xebec, and hol 
 low 4 Come on you Christian dogs, 1 am ready 
 for you ! J I have some doubts whether the vessel ever 
 noticed us : if she did she despised us ; for she 
 tacked and stood to the south-west. This was no 
 sooner perceived by our gallant commander, than 
 he ordered the xebec to lay to, and swore that he 
 would pursue the uncircumcised dogs and board 
 them ; but he first would prudently ask the ap 
 probation of t^he passengers, who instantly deter 
 mined one and all that their business was such 
 that they must insist upon the captain s making 
 his best way to port. The captain consented, but 
 not without much grumbling at his misfortune in 
 losing so fine a prize ; and declared that, when 
 he had landed his passengers, he would directly 
 quit the port and renew the chase. After a smart 
 run we dropt anchor in the port of Alexandria, 
 called by the Turks Scandaroon. This is the site 
 of the ancient Alexandria, founded by Alexander 
 the Great ; though its present appearance would 
 not induce an opinion of so magnificent a founder. 
 It lies not far from the westernmost branch 6f the 
 river Nile, by which, in ancient days, it was sup 
 plied with water. The antiquarian eye may pos

 the vestiges of the ruins of its ancient grandeur ; 
 but a vulgar traveller, from the appearance of the 
 harbour choked with sand, the miserable buildings 
 and more wretched inhabitants of the town, would 
 not be led to conclude that this was the port which 
 rose triumphant on the ruins of Tyre and Car 
 thage. We here hired camels ; and being joined 
 by a number of pilgrims and traders, collected 
 irom various parts of the Levant, we proceeded 
 towards Grand Cairo, the present capital of Egypt ; 
 and after travelling three days or rather three 
 nights for we generally reposed in the heat of 
 the day, which is severe from one hour after the 
 sun s rising until it sets we came to a pretty 
 town on the west bank of the Nile, called Gize, 
 and hence passed over on rafts to the city of 
 Grand Cairo, called by the Turks Almizer, the 
 suburbs of which extend to the river ; but the 
 principal town commences its proper boundaries 
 at about three miles east of the Nile. I was now 
 within a comparatively short distance of two mag 
 nificent curiosities which I had ever been desirous 
 of beholding : the city of Jerusalem was only 
 about five days journey to the south-east, and i 
 had even caught a glimpse of the pyramids near 
 Gize. 1 went with my masters and others to see 
 a deep stoned pit in the castle, called Joseph s 
 well, and said to have been dug by the direction 
 of that patriarch. I am not antiqarian enough to 
 know the particular style of architecture of Jo 
 seph s well ; but the water was sweet and ex 
 tremely cold. The Turks say that Ptitiphar s 
 r vifc did not cease to persecute Joseph with her

 iove after he was released from prison and advan 
 ced to power ; but that the patriarch was warned 
 by a dream to dig this well, and invite her to 
 drink of the water, which she had no sooner done, 
 than one cup of it so effectually cooled her de 
 sires, that she was ever afterwards an eminent 
 example of the most frigid chastity. In ,0rand 
 Cairo we were joined by many pilgrims from 
 Palestine and the adjacent countries. The third 
 day our caravan, which consisted of three hundred 
 camels and dromedaries, set out for Medina under 
 the convoy of a troop of Mamaluke guards, a taw 
 ny, raw-boned, ill clothed people. Some of the 
 merchants and even pilgrims made a handsome ap 
 pearance in person, dress, and equipage. I was my 
 self well mounted upon a camel, and carried with 
 me only my leather wallet of drugs, which I dis 
 pensed freely v among the pilgrims ; my masters 
 receiving the ordinary pay, while I collected many 
 small sums, which the gratitude of my patients ad 
 ded to the usual fee. We passed near the north 
 arm of the Red Sea 3 and then pursued our jour 
 ney south until we struck the same arm again, 
 near the place where the learned Wortley Monta 
 gue has concluded that the Israelites, under the 
 conduct of Moses, effected their passage. The 
 breadth of the sea here is great, and the waters 
 deep and turbulent. The infidel may sneer if he 
 chooses ; but, for my own part, 1 am convinced 
 beyond a doubt, that, if the Israelites passed in 
 this place, it must have been by the miraculous 
 interposition of a divine power. I could not re 
 gain from reflecting upon the infatuated temerity

 which impelled the Egyptian king (o follow them, 
 Weil does the Latin poet exclaini-^-Qwem Deus 
 oult perdere, prius dementat ! We then travelled 
 east until we came to a small village called Ta- 
 dah. Here we filled many goat-skins with water, 
 and laded our camels with them. In addition to 
 my wallet 1 received two goat-skins or bags of 
 water upon my camel. The weight this useful 
 animal will carry is astonishing ; and the facility 
 and promptitude with which he kneels to receive 
 his rider and burden surprising. We now entered 
 the confines of Arabia Petrea, very aptly denom 
 inated the Rocky Arabia ; for, journeying south 
 east, we passed over many ridges of mountains 
 which appeared of solid rocks, while the rallies 
 and plains between them were almost a quick 
 sand. Not a tree, shrub, or vegetable, is to be 
 seen. In these vallies the sun poured intolerable 
 day, and its reflections from the land were insup 
 portable. No refreshing breeze is here felt. The 
 intelligent traveller often fears the rising of the 
 wind, which blows such sulty gales that man and 
 beast often sink beneath them, &quot; never to rise 
 again,&quot; or, when agitated into a tempest, drive 
 the sand with such tumultuous violence as to over 
 whelm whole caravans... Such indeed were the 
 stories told me as I passed ; these dreary plains. 
 The only inconvenience I sustained arose from the 
 intense heat of the sun, and the chills of the night 
 which our thin garments were not calculated to 
 exclude. On the third day after we left Tadah, 
 the water which we transported on our camels was 
 nearly expended. These extraordinary -animal*

 had not drank but once since our departure. Near 
 the middle of the fourth day, 1 observed our cam 
 els snuff the air, and soon set off in a brisk trot, 
 and just before night brought us to water. This 
 was contained in only one deep well, dug like a 
 reversed pyramid, with steps to descend on every 
 side to the depth of one hundred feet ; yet the 
 sagacity of the camel had discovered this water at 
 perhaps twenty miles distance. So my fellow 
 travellers asserted ; but I have since thought, 
 whether these camels, from frequently passing this 
 desert country, did not discover their approach to 
 water rathef from the eye noting familiar objects 
 than the actual scenting the water itself. A horse 
 that has journeyed the whole day will quicken his 
 step at night, upon a familiar road, within some 
 miles of an accustomed stable. Our escort de 
 lighted in the marvellous. Many a dreadful story 
 did they tell of poisonous winds and overwhelm 
 ing sands ; and of the fierce wandering Arabs, 
 who captured whole caravans and ate their prison 
 ers, Many a bloody battle had they fought with 
 this cruel banditti, in which, according to their 
 narratives, they always came off conquerors. Fre 
 quently were we alarmed, to be in readiness to 
 combat these savage free-booters ; though I never 
 saw but two of the wild Arabs in the whole of our 
 journey. They joined us at a little village east 
 of Islarnboul, and accosted us with great civility. 
 They were dressed in blue frocks, girded round 
 the waste with party-coloured sashes, in which 
 were stuck a pistol and a long knife. Their legs 
 were bare, and sheep-skin caps covered their head^,

 Their complexions were sallow, but their garments 
 and persons were clean. Indeed their dress and 
 address evinced them to be of a more civilized 
 race than our guards, who affected to treat them 
 with lofty hauteur ; and when they departed as 
 sured us that they were spies, and that an attack 
 from their countrymen might now be apprehended 
 with certainty ; if, said the leader of our escort, 
 they are not terrified by finding you under our 
 protection.

 heads with the hem of his garment, while others 
 still more devout prostrated themselves on the 
 ground, and kissed the prints of his footsteps in 
 the sand. Though I was assured that he was fill 
 ed with divine love, and conferred felicity on all 
 who touched him, yet to outward appearance he 
 was the most disgusting contemptible object I had 
 ever seen. Figure to yourselves, my readers, a 
 little decrepit old man, made shorter by stooping, 
 with a countenance which exhibited a vacant 
 stare, his head bald, his finger and toe-nails as 
 long as hawks claws, his attire filthy, his face, 
 neck, arms, and legs begrimed with dirt and 
 swarming with vermin, and you will have some 
 faint idea of this mussulman saint. As I was too 
 reasonable to expect that holiness existed in a 
 man s exterior, v l waited to hear him speak ; anti 
 cipating from his lips the profoundest wisdom, 
 delivered in the honeyed accents of the saints in 
 bliss. At length he spake ; and his speech be 
 trayed him a mere idiot. While this astonished 
 me, it raised the respect of his admirers, who es 
 timated his sanctity in an inverse ratio to the 
 strength of his intellects. If they could have 
 ascertained that he was born an idiot, I verily 
 believe they would have adored him ; for the Ma 
 hometans are taught by their Alcoran, that the 
 souls of saints are often lodged in the bodies of 
 idiots ; and these pious souls being so intent on 
 the joys of paradise is the true reason that the ac 
 tions of their bodies are so little suited to the 
 manners of this world. This saint, however, 
 did not aspire to the sanctity of a genuine idiot

 though I fancy his modesty injured his preferment 
 for he certainly had very fair pretensions. It 
 was resolved that the holy man should go with us ; 
 and, to my great mortification and disgust, he was 
 mounted behind me on the same camel ; my Ma- 
 hometant friends probably conceiving that he 
 would so far communicate his sanctity by contact, 
 as that it might affect my conversion to their faith. 
 Whatever were their motives, in the embraces of 
 this nanseous being, with the people prostrating

 This canopy is renewed annually by the bashaw

 all are lighted on certain public occasions,

 from my blessed companion to be permitted to 
 enter this sanctified building. The Arabians are 
 proiusely extravagant in the titles they bestow on 
 the city of Medina ; calling it the most holy, 
 most renowned, most excellent city ; the sanctuary 
 of the blessed fugitive ; model of the refulgent 
 city in the celestial paradise ; and some of the 
 great vulgar suppose that when the world shall 
 be destroyed this city, with the prophet s remains, 
 will be transported by angels with all its inhab 
 itants to paradise. We tarried there but a few 
 hours, as the great object of the devotions of the 
 pilgrims was Mecca. Pilgrimages are performed 
 to both places ; but those to Medina are not indis

 Mecca are enjoined by the Alcoran itself The

 The Author visits Mecca : Description of the Al

 BEING freed from my blessed companion, I had 
 an agreeable journey from Medina to Mecca, 
 which is the most ancient city in all Arabia ; 
 &amp;gt;situated about two hundred miles south-east of Me 
 dina, twenty-one degrees and forty-five minutes 
 north latitude, and one hundred and sixteen de 
 grees east longitude from Philadelphia, according 
 to late American calculations. 1 saw the great 
 mosque in the centre of Mecca, which, it is 
 said, far surpasses in grandeur that of Sancta So 
 phia in Constantinople. It certainly is a very 
 august building, the roof of which is refulgent ; 
 but even the inhabitants smiled at my credulity. 
 when I observed that I had read it was covered 
 with plated gold. This mosque contains within 
 its limits the grand object of the mussulman s pil

 have been built by the hands of the patriarch 
 Abraham ; to confirm which the Arabian priests 
 show a black stone, upon which they say Abra 
 ham laid his son Isaac, when he had bound him in 
 preparation for his intended sacrifice. This stone 
 and building were great objects of veneration be 
 fore the mission of the prophet, and he artfully 
 availed himself of this popular prejudice, in ren 
 dering the highest respect to the holy house in his 
 life-time, and enjoining upon his followers, with 
 out distinction among males, to visit it once in 
 their lives. The advent of the prophet was said 
 to be announced from the four corners of the house, 
 which exhibit the four cardinal points. Few pil 
 grims are permitted to enter this sacred venerable 
 building ; but after travelling some of them per 
 haps a thousand miles, they are content to pros 
 trate themselves in the courts whiclf surround it. 
 Few Mahometans perform this pilgrimage in per 
 son ; those who do are highly respected. This 
 pilgrimage was enjoined by the prophet to be per 
 formed in person; but, when he laid this injunc 
 tion, it is not probable he anticipated the extensive 
 spread of his doctrines. So long as his disciples 
 were limited by the boundaries of Arabia, or had 
 only extended themselves over a part of Syria, 
 this pious journey was practicable and easy; but 
 when the crescent rose triumphant on the sea-coast 
 cmd most of the interior of Africa, when it shone 
 with splendor in Persia, Tartary, and Turkey, 
 and even adorned the Moorish minarit in Spain, 
 actual pilgrimage was deemed impracticable ; and

 You think a Jew will always deceive in money

 my father s account. Now what do you demand 
 for restoring me to health ? Nothing, replied I, 
 overjoyed at his probity ; restore me my money, 
 and you are welcome to my services. This must 
 not be, said the son of Adonah, I have done wick

 own conscience. I will allow you in addition to 
 the one thousand dollars, two thousand more for 
 your assistance as a physician ; and then will ad

 your word to repay me when you are able. I 
 was astonished. I seized his hand and felt his

 now begun to doubt his promises, and blame my

 Vvhich consisted of a few clothes, and to the am

 to the beach, and then took an affectionate leave of 
 me, presenting me with the value of ten dollars as

 could I tell a stranger, a man who appeared a 
 mussulmari by his garb, that I was a ruuaway 
 slave ? While I was perplexing myself what to say, 
 the man who had decoyed me on board appeared, 
 He was a passenger, and claimed me as his slave, 
 having purchased me, as he said, for four hund- 
 dred sequins of a Jew, my former master, and. 
 meant to carry me with him to Tunis. I was 
 now awakened to all the horrors of my situation. 
 I dared not irritate my new master by contradic 
 tions, and acquiesced in his story in dumb despair, 
 On the eighth day after we departed from Scan- 
 daroon the vessel made Cape Bona, and expected 
 soon to anchor in the port of Tunis. My master 
 had a Portuguese slave on board, who slept in the 
 birth with me. He spoke a little broken English, 
 having been formerly a sailor on board a vessel of 
 that nation. He gave me the mo?t alarming ap 
 prehensions of the cruelty of our master, but flat 
 tered me by saying that the Tunese in general 
 vrere more mild with their slaves than the Alge- 
 rines, and allowed a freer intercourse with the 
 European merchants : and by their interference 
 we might obtain our liberty. While my fellow

 slave slept, I lay agonising with the dread of en 
 tering the port of Tunis. Often did I wish that 
 some friendly rock or kindly leak would sink me 
 and my misfortunes ; and I was nigh being grat 
 ified in my desperate wishes ; for the same night 
 a tremendous storm arose, and the gale struck us 
 with such violence, that our sails were instantly 
 flittered into rags. We could not show a yard 
 of canvass, and were obliged to scud under bare 
 poles. Tbe night was excessively dark ; and, to 
 increase our distress, our ballast shifted and we 
 were obliged to cut away our masts by the board 
 to save us from foundering. The vessel righted ; 
 but being strong and light, and the hatchways be 
 ing well secured, our captain was only fearful of 
 being driven on some Christian coast. The next 
 Might the wind lulled : and the morning after the 
 sun arose clear, and we found ourselves off the 
 coast of Sardinia, and within gun-shot of an arm 
 ed vessel. She proved to be a Portuguese frigate. 
 To the confusion and dismay of our captain and 
 passengers, and to the great joy of myself and 
 fellow slave, the frigate hoisted her colours, manned 
 her boats, and boarded us. No sooner was his 
 national flag displayed than the overjoyed Portu 
 guese ran below and liberated me from my fetters, 
 hugged me in raptures, and, hauling me upon deck, 
 the first man we met was our master, whom he 
 saluted with a kick, and then spit in his face. I 
 must confess that this reverse of fortune made me 
 feel for the wretched mussulman, who stood quiv 
 ering with apprehensions of instant death. I could . 
 not refrain from endeavouring to prevent the Por 
 tuguese from avenging himself for the cruelties be

 had suflfered under this Barbarian. The boate 
 soon boarded us and secured the captain and crew, 
 whom they treated with as bitter contempt ;^ 
 my fellow had exercised towards our late master. 
 This poor fellow soon introduced me to his coun 
 trymen with a brief account of my country and 
 misfortunes.

 Conclusion. 
 
 THE Portuguese officers treated me with polite 
 ness ; and when they were rifling the vessel, re 
 quested me to select my property from the plunder. 
 I was then sent on board the frigate. The cap 
 tain expressed much joy at being the means of my 
 deliverance, and told me that the Portuguese had a 
 sincere regard for the Americans ; and that he re 
 ceived express orders to protect our commerce from 
 the Barbary corsairs. The prisoners were brought 
 on board and confined below ; and after every 
 thing valuable was taken from the prize, the ship 
 stood for the Straits of Gibraltar, leaving a boat 
 to fire the Tunese vessel. I never received more 
 civility than from the officers of this frigate, la 
 compliment to them, 1 was obliged to throw my 
 Mahometan dress over the ship s side ; for they 
 furnished me with every necessary, and many or 
 namental articles of European clothing. The sur 
 geon was particularly attentive. I lent hirn some 
 assistance among the sick, his mate being unwell \

 ant], among other presents, he gave me a hand-* 
 some pocket-case of surgical instruments. After a 
 pleasant voyage, we anchored in port Logus in 
 the southern extremity of Portugal. PJere I re 
 ceived the agreeable intelligence that the United 
 States were about commencing a treaty with the 
 dey of Algiers, by the agency of Joseph Donald 
 son, junesq. which would liberate my unhappy 
 fellow citizens, and secure the American commerce 
 from future depredations. Without landing, I had 
 the good fortune to obtain a passage on board an, 
 English merchantman bound for Bristol, captain, 
 Joseph Joceline commander. We had a prospe 
 rous voyage to the Land s End ; and, very fortu 
 nately for me, just oil the little isle of Lundy, 
 spake with a brigantine bound to Chesapeak Bay, 
 captain John Harris commander. In thirty-two 
 days we made v Cape Charles, the north chop of 
 the Chesapeak, and 1 prevailed upon the cap- 
 tnin to set me on shore ; and on the third day of 
 May, 1795, I landed in my native country after 
 nn absence of seven years and one month ; about 
 six years of which I had been a slave. I purcha 
 sed a horse, and hastened home to my parents, 
 who received me as one risen from the dead. I 
 shall not attempt to describe their emotions, or 
 my own raptures. I had suffered hunger, sickness, 
 fatigue, insult, stripes, wounds, and every other 
 cruel injury; and was now under the roc f of the 
 kindest and tenderest of parents. I had been de- 
 ^rnded to a slave, and was now advanced to a 
 citizen of the freest country in the universe. I 
 had been lost to my parents, friends, and coun- 
 tvy : and now four). I, in the embraces and con-

 gratulations of the former, and the rights- and 
 protections of the latter, a rich compensation for 
 all past miseries. From some minutes I preser 
 ved I compiled these memoirs ; and, by the sol 
 icitations of some respectable friends, have been 
 induced to submit them to the public. A long 
 disuse of my native tongue will apologise to the 
 learned reader for any inaccuracies. 
 
 I now mean to unite myself to some amiable 
 woman, to pursue my practice as a physician, 
 which I hope will be attended with more success 
 than when essayed with the inexperience and 
 giddiness of youth ; to contribute cheerfully to tbe 
 support of our excellent government, which I have 
 learnt to adore in schools of despotism ; and thus 
 secure to myself the enviable character of an use 
 ful physician, a good father, and worthy FEDERAL 
 citizen. 
 
 My ardent wish is, that my fellow cifens 
 may profit by my misfortunes. If they peruse 
 these pages with attention, they will perceive the 
 necessity of uniting our federal strength to en 
 force a due respect among other nations. Let 
 us one and all endeavour to sustain the general 
 government. Let no foreign emissaries inflame 
 tis against one nation, by raking up the ashes of 
 long extinguished enmity ; or delude us into the 
 extravagant schemes of another, by recurring to 
 fancied gratitude. Our first object is union 
 among ourselves. For to no nation besides the 
 United States can that ancient saying be more
